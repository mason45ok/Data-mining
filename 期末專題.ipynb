It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.It is used for:web development (server-side),software development,mathematics,system scripting.What can Python do?Python can be used on a server to create web applications.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.Why Python?Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines thansome other programming languages.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.Good to knowThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything otherthan security updates, is still quite popular.In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.Python Syntax compared to other programming languagesPython was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.ExampleGet your own Python Serverprint(\"Hello, World!\")-----Python Getting StartedPython InstallMany PCs and Macs will have python already installed.To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>python --versionTo check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:python --versionIf you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you candownload it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/Python QuickstartPython is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>python helloworld.pyWhere \"helloworld.py\" is the name of your python file.Let\\'s write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.helloworld.pyprint(\"Hello, World!\")Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>python helloworld.pyThe output should read:Hello, World!Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe Python Command LineTo test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be runas a command line itself.Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pythonOr, if the \"python\" command did not work, you can try \"py\":C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pyFrom there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pythonPython 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]on win32Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.>>> print(\"Hello, World!\")Which will write \"Hello, World!\" in the command line:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pythonPython 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]on win32Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.>>> print(\"Hello, World!\")Hello, World!Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:exit()-----Python SyntaxExecute Python SyntaxAs we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:>>> print(\"Hello, World!\")Hello, World!On this pageExecute Python SyntaxPython IndentationPython VariablesPython CommentsExercisesOr by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>python myfile.pyPython IndentationIndentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.ExampleGet your own Python Serverif 5 > 2:  print(\"Five is greater than two!\")Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:ExampleSyntax Error:if 5 > 2:print(\"Five is greater than two!\")The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.Exampleif 5 > 2: print(\"Five is greater than two!\")  if 5 > 2:        print(\"Five is greater than two!\") You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:ExampleSyntax Error:if 5 > 2: print(\"Five is greater than two!\")         print(\"Five is greater than two!\")ADVERTISEMENTPython VariablesIn Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:ExampleVariables in Python:x = 5y = \"Hello, World!\"Python has no command for declaring a variable.You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.CommentsPython has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:ExampleComments in Python:#This is a comment.print(\"Hello, World!\")-----Python CommentsComments can be used to explain Python code.Comments can be used to make the code more readable.Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.Creating a CommentComments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:ExampleGet your own Python Server#This is a commentprint(\"Hello, World!\")Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:Exampleprint(\"Hello, World!\") #This is a commentA comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:Example#print(\"Hello, World!\")print(\"Cheers, Mate!\")ADVERTISEMENTMultiline CommentsPython does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:Example#This is a comment#written in#more than just one lineprint(\"Hello, World!\")Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:Example\"\"\"This is a commentwritten in more than just one line\"\"\"print(\"Hello, World!\")As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.-----Python VariablesVariablesVariables are containers for storing data values.Creating VariablesPython has no command for declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.ExampleGet your own Python Serverx = 5y = \"John\"print(x)print(y)Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.Examplex = 4       # x is of type intx = \"Sally\" # x is now of type strprint(x)CastingIf you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.Examplex = str(3)    # x will be \\'3\\'y = int(3)    # y will be 3z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0ADVERTISEMENTGet the TypeYou can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.Examplex = 5y = \"John\"print(type(x))print(type(y))You will learn more about data types and casting later in this tutorial.Single or Double Quotes?String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:Examplex = \"John\"# is the same asx = \\'John\\'Case-SensitiveVariable names are case-sensitive.ExampleThis will create two variables:a = 4A = \"Sally\"#A will not overwrite a-----Python - Variable NamesVariable NamesA variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age,carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore characterA variable name cannot start with a numberA variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.ExampleGet your own Python ServerLegal variable names:myvar = \"John\"my_var = \"John\"_my_var = \"John\"myVar = \"John\"MYVAR = \"John\"myvar2 = \"John\"ExampleIllegal variable names:2myvar = \"John\"my-var = \"John\"my var = \"John\"Remember that variable names are case-sensitiveADVERTISEMENTMulti Words Variable NamesVariable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:Camel CaseEach word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:myVariableName = \"John\"Pascal CaseEach word starts with a capital letter:MyVariableName = \"John\"Snake CaseEach word is separated by an underscore character:my_variable_name = \"John\"-----Python Variables - Assign Multiple ValuesMany Values to Multiple VariablesPython allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:ExampleGet your own Python Serverx, y, z = \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"print(x)print(y)print(z)Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.One Value to Multiple VariablesAnd you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:Examplex = y = z = \"Orange\"print(x)print(y)print(z)Unpack a CollectionIf you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.ExampleUnpack a list:fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]x, y, z = fruitsprint(x)print(y)print(z)Learn more about unpacking in our Unpack Tuples Chapter.-----Python - Output VariablesOutput VariablesThe Python print() function is often used to output variables.ExampleGet your own Python Serverx = \"Python is awesome\"print(x)In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:Examplex = \"Python\"y = \"is\"z = \"awesome\"print(x, y, z)You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:Examplex = \"Python \"y = \"is \"z = \"awesome\"print(x + y + z)Notice the space character after \"Python \" and \"is \", without them the result would be \"Pythonisawesome\".For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:Examplex = 5y = 10print(x + y)In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:Examplex = 5y = \"John\"print(x + y)The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separatethem with commas, which even support different data types:Examplex = 5y = \"John\"print(x, y)-----Python - Global VariablesGlobal VariablesVariables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the functionx = \"awesome\"def myfunc():  print(\"Python is \" + x)myfunc()If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.ExampleCreate a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variablex = \"awesome\"def myfunc():  x = \"fantastic\"  print(\"Python is \" + x)myfunc()print(\"Python is \" + x)ADVERTISEMENTThe global KeywordNormally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.ExampleIf you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:def myfunc():  global x  x = \"fantastic\"myfunc()print(\"Python is \" + x)Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.ExampleTo change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:x = \"awesome\"def myfunc():  global x  x = \"fantastic\"myfunc()print(\"Python is \" + x)-----Python - Variable ExercisesTest Yourself With ExercisesNow you have learned a lot about variables, and how to use them in Python.Are you ready for a test?Try to insert the missing part to make the code work as expected:Exercise:Create a variable named carname and assign the value Volvo to it. = \"\"Go to the Exercise section and test all of our Python Variable Exercises:-----Python Data TypesBuilt-in Data TypesIn programming, data type is an important concept.Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:Text Type:strNumeric Types: int, float, complexSequence Types: list, tuple, rangeMapping Type: dictSet Types:set, frozensetBoolean Type: boolBinary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryviewNone Type:NoneTypeGetting the Data TypeYou can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint the data type of the variable x:x = 5print(type(x))Setting the Data TypeIn Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:ExampleData TypeTry itx = \"Hello World\" strx = 20intx = 20.5floatx = 1jcomplexx = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"] listx = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\") tuplex = range(6) rangex = \"name\" : \"John\", \"age\" : 36 dictx = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\" setx = frozenset(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\") frozensetx = Trueboolx = b\"Hello\" bytesx = bytearray(5) bytearrayx = memoryview(bytes(5)) memoryviewx = NoneNoneTypeADVERTISEMENTSetting the Specific Data TypeIf you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:ExampleData TypeTry itx = str(\"Hello World\") strx = int(20)intx = float(20.5) floatx = complex(1j) complexx = list((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) listx = tuple((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) tuplex = range(6) rangex = dict(name=\"John\", age=36) dictx = set((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) setx = frozenset((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) frozensetx = bool(5)boolx = bytes(5) bytesx = bytearray(5) bytearrayx = memoryview(bytes(5)) memoryviewTest Yourself With ExercisesExercise:The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?x = 5print(type(x))-----Python NumbersPython NumbersThere are three numeric types in Python:intfloatcomplexVariables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:ExampleGet your own Python Serverx = 1    # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complexTo verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:Exampleprint(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))IntInt, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.ExampleIntegers:x = 1y = 35656222554887711z = -3255522print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))FloatFloat, or \"floating point number\" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.ExampleFloats:x = 1.10y = 1.0z = -35.59print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))Float can also be scientific numbers with an \"e\" to indicate the power of 10.ExampleFloats:x = 35e3y = 12E4z = -87.7e100print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))ADVERTISEMENTComplexComplex numbers are written with a \"j\" as the imaginary part:ExampleComplex:x = 3+5jy = 5jz = -5jprint(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))Type ConversionYou can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:ExampleConvert from one type to another:x = 1    # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complex#convert from int to float:a = float(x)#convert from float to int:b = int(y)#convert from int to complex:c = complex(x)print(a)print(b)print(c)print(type(a))print(type(b))print(type(c))Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.Random NumberPython does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python hasa built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:ExampleImport the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:import randomprint(random.randrange(1, 10))In our Random Module Reference you will learn more about the Random module.-----Python CastingSpecify a Variable TypeThere may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can bedone with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string representsa whole number)float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literalsExampleGet your own Python ServerIntegers:x = int(1)   # x will be 1y = int(2.8) # y will be 2z = int(\"3\") # z will be 3ExampleFloats:x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8z = float(\"3\")   # z will be 3.0w = float(\"4.2\") # w will be 4.2ExampleStrings:x = str(\"s1\") # x will be \\'s1\\'y = str(2)    # y will be \\'2\\'z = str(3.0)  # z will be \\'3.0\\'-----Python StringsStringsStrings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.\\'hello\\' is the same as \"hello\".You can display a string literal with the print() function:ExampleGet your own Python Serverprint(\"Hello\")print(\\'Hello\\')Assign String to a VariableAssigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:Examplea = \"Hello\"print(a)Multiline StringsYou can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:ExampleYou can use three double quotes:a = \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetur adipiscing elit,sed do eiusmod tempor incididuntut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"\"\"print(a)Or three single quotes:Examplea = \\'\\'\\'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetur adipiscing elit,sed do eiusmod tempor incididuntut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\\'\\'\\'print(a)Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in thecode.ADVERTISEMENTStrings are ArraysLike many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.ExampleGet the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):a = \"Hello, World!\"print(a[1])Looping Through a StringSince strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with afor loop.ExampleLoop through the letters in the word \"banana\":for x in \"banana\":  print(x)Learn more about For Loops in our Python For Loops chapter.String LengthTo get the length of a string, use the len() function.ExampleThe len() function returns the length of a string:a = \"Hello, World!\"print(len(a))Check StringTo check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use thekeyword in.ExampleCheck if \"free\" is present in the following text:txt = \"The best things in life are free!\"print(\"free\" in txt)Use it in an if statement:ExamplePrint only if \"free\" is present:txt = \"The best things in life are free!\"if \"free\" in txt:  print(\"Yes, \\'free\\' is present.\")Learn more about If statements in our Python If...Else chapter.Check if NOTTo check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can usethe keyword not in.ExampleCheck if \"expensive\" is NOT present in the following text:txt = \"The best things in life are free!\"print(\"expensive\" not in txt)Use it in an if statement:Exampleprint only if \"expensive\" is NOT present:txt = \"The best things in life are free!\"if \"expensive\" not in txt:  print(\"No, \\'expensive\\' is NOT present.\")-----Python - Slicing StringsSlicingYou can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGet the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):b = \"Hello, World!\"print(b[2:5])Note: The first character has index 0.Slice From the StartBy leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:ExampleGet the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):b = \"Hello, World!\"print(b[:5])ADVERTISEMENTSlice To the EndBy leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:ExampleGet the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:b = \"Hello, World!\"print(b[2:])Negative IndexingUse negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:ExampleGet the characters:From: \"o\" in \"World!\" (position -5)To, but not included: \"d\" in \"World!\" (position -2):b = \"Hello, World!\"print(b[-5:-2])-----Python - Modify StringsPython has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.Upper CaseExampleGet your own Python ServerThe upper() method returns the string in upper case:a = \"Hello, World!\"print(a.upper())Lower CaseExampleThe lower() method returns the string in lower case:a = \"Hello, World!\"print(a.lower())Remove WhitespaceWhitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.ExampleThe strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:a = \" Hello, World! \"print(a.strip()) # returns \"Hello, World!\"ADVERTISEMENTReplace StringExampleThe replace() method replaces a string with another string:a = \"Hello, World!\"print(a.replace(\"H\", \"J\"))Split StringThe split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separatorbecomes the list items.ExampleThe split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:a = \"Hello, World!\"print(a.split(\",\")) # returns [\\'Hello\\', \\' World!\\']Learn more about Lists in our Python Lists chapter.String MethodsLearn more about String Methods with our String Methods Reference-----Python - String ConcatenationString ConcatenationTo concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.ExampleGet your own Python ServerMerge variable a with variable b into variable c:a = \"Hello\"b = \"World\"c = a + bprint(c)ExampleTo add a space between them, add a \" \":a = \"Hello\"b = \"World\"c = a + \" \" + bprint(c)-----Python - Format - StringsString FormatAs we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:ExampleGet your own Python Serverage = 36txt = \"My name is John, I am \" + ageprint(txt)But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them inthe string where the placeholders  are:ExampleUse the format() method to insert numbers into strings:age = 36txt = \"My name is John, and I am \"print(txt.format(age))The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into therespective placeholders:Examplequantity = 3itemno = 567price = 49.95myorder = \"I want  pieces of item  for  dollars.\"print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))You can use index numbers 0 to be sure the arguments are placed in the correctplaceholders:Examplequantity = 3itemno = 567price = 49.95myorder = \"I want to pay 2 dollars for 0 pieces of item 1.\"print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))Learn more about String Formatting in our String Formatting chapter.-----Python - Escape CharactersEscape CharacterTo insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.An escape character is a backslash \\\\ followed by the character you want to insert.An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:ExampleGet your own Python ServerYou will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:txt = \"We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.\"To fix this problem, use the escape character \\\\\":ExampleThe escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would notbe allowed:txt = \"We are the so-called \\\\\"Vikings\\\\\" from the north.\"Escape CharactersOther escape characters used in Python:CodeResultTry it\\\\\\'Single Quote\\\\\\\\Backslash\\\\nNew Line\\\\rCarriage Return\\\\tTab\\\\bBackspace\\\\fForm Feed\\\\oooOctal value\\\\xhhHex value-----Python - String MethodsString MethodsPython has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.Note: All string methods return new values. They do not change the original string.MethodDescriptioncapitalize() Converts the first character to upper casecasefold()Converts string into lower casecenter()Returns a centered stringcount()Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a stringencode()Returns an encoded version of the stringendswith()Returns true if the string ends with the specified valueexpandtabs() Sets the tab size of the stringfind()Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was foundformat()Formats specified values in a stringformat_map() Formats specified values in a stringindex()Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was foundisalnum()Returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumericisalpha()Returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabetisascii()Returns True if all characters in the string are ascii charactersisdecimal()Returns True if all characters in the string are decimalsisdigit()Returns True if all characters in the string are digitsisidentifier() Returns True if the string is an identifierislower()Returns True if all characters in the string are lower caseisnumeric()Returns True if all characters in the string are numericisprintable() Returns True if all characters in the string are printableisspace()Returns True if all characters in the string are whitespacesistitle()Returns True if the string follows the rules of a titleisupper()Returns True if all characters in the string are upper casejoin()Joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the stringljust()Returns a left justified version of the stringlower()Converts a string into lower caselstrip()Returns a left trim version of the stringmaketrans()Returns a translation table to be used in translationspartition()Returns a tuple where the string is parted into three partsreplace()Returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified valuerfind()Searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was foundrindex()Searches the string for a specified value and returns the last position of where it was foundrjust()Returns a right justified version of the stringrpartition() Returns a tuple where the string is parted into three partsrsplit()Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a listrstrip()Returns a right trim version of the stringsplit()Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a listsplitlines() Splits the string at line breaks and returns a liststartswith() Returns true if the string starts with the specified valuestrip()Returns a trimmed version of the stringswapcase()Swaps cases, lower case becomes upper case and vice versatitle()Converts the first character of each word to upper casetranslate()Returns a translated stringupper()Converts a string into upper casezfill()Fills the string with a specified number of 0 values at the beginning-----Python - String ExercisesTest Yourself With ExercisesNow you have learned a lot about Strings, and how to use them in Python.Are you ready for a test?Try to insert the missing part to make the code work as expected:Test Yourself With ExercisesExercise:Use the len function to print the length of the string.x = \"Hello World\"print()Go to the Exercise section and test all of our Python Strings Exercises:-----Python BooleansBooleans represent one of two values: True or False.Boolean ValuesIn programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:ExampleGet your own Python Serverprint(10 > 9)print(10 == 9)print(10  a:  print(\"b is greater than a\")else:  print(\"b is not greater than a\")Evaluate Values and VariablesThe bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or Falsein return,ExampleEvaluate a string and a number:print(bool(\"Hello\"))print(bool(15))ExampleEvaluate two variables:x = \"Hello\"y = 15print(bool(x))print(bool(y))ADVERTISEMENTMost Values are TrueAlmost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.Any string is True, except empty strings.Any number is True, except 0.Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.ExampleThe following will return True:bool(\"abc\")bool(123)bool([\"apple\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"])Some Values are FalseIn fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], , \"\", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.ExampleThe following will return False:bool(False)bool(None)bool(0)bool(\"\")bool(())bool([])bool()One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:Exampleclass myclass():  def __len__(self):    return 0myobj = myclass()print(bool(myobj))Functions can Return a BooleanYou can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:ExamplePrint the answer of a function:def myFunction() :  return Trueprint(myFunction())You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:ExamplePrint \"YES!\" if the function returns True, otherwise print \"NO!\":def myFunction() :  return Trueif myFunction():  print(\"YES!\")else:  print(\"NO!\")Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:ExampleCheck if an object is an integer or not:x = 200print(isinstance(x, int))-----Python OperatorsPython OperatorsOperators are used to perform operations on variables and values.In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:ExampleGet your own Python Serverprint(10 + 5)Python divides the operators in the following groups:Arithmetic operatorsAssignment operatorsComparison operatorsLogical operatorsIdentity operatorsMembership operatorsBitwise operatorsPython Arithmetic OperatorsArithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematicaloperations:OperatorNameExampleTry it+Additionx + y-Subtractionx - y*Multiplication x * y/Divisionx / y%Modulusx % y**Exponentiation x ** y//Floor division x // yPython Assignment OperatorsAssignment operators are used to assign values to variables:OperatorExampleSame AsTry it=x = 5x = 5+=x += 3x = x + 3-=x -= 3x = x - 3*=x *= 3x = x * 3/=x /= 3x = x / 3%=x %= 3x = x % 3//=x //= 3x = x // 3**=x **= 3x = x ** 3&=x &= 3x = x & 3|=x |= 3x = x | 3^=x ^= 3x = x ^ 3>>=x >>= 3x = x >> 3Greater than x > y=Greater than or equal to x >= y>Signed right shift Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off x >> 2Operator PrecedenceOperator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.ExampleParentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))ExampleMultiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefor multiplications are evaluated before additions:print(100 + 5 * 3)The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:OperatorDescriptionTry it()Parentheses**Exponentiation+x  -x  ~xUnary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT*  /  //  %Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus+  -Addition and subtraction>Bitwise left and right shifts&Bitwise AND^Bitwise XOR|Bitwise OR==  !=  >  >=  ExampleWhat is the data type of a list?mylist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]print(type(mylist))The list() ConstructorIt is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.ExampleUsing the list() constructor to make a List:thislist = list((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) # note the double round-bracketsprint(thislist)Python Collections (Arrays)There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier,dictionaries are unordered.When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.-----Python - Access List ItemsAccess ItemsList items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint the second item of the list:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]print(thislist[1])Note: The first item has index 0.Negative IndexingNegative indexing means start from the end-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.ExamplePrint the last item of the list:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]print(thislist[-1])Range of IndexesYou can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to endthe range.When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.ExampleReturn the third, fourth, and fifth item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\"]print(thislist[2:5])Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).Remember that the first item has index 0.By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:ExampleThis example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, \"kiwi\":thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\"]print(thislist[:4])By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:ExampleThis example returns the items from \"cherry\" to the end:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\"]print(thislist[2:])ADVERTISEMENTRange of Negative IndexesSpecify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:ExampleThis example returns the items from \"orange\" (-4) to, but NOT including \"mango\" (-1):thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\"]print(thislist[-4:-1])Check if Item ExistsTo determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:ExampleCheck if \"apple\" is present in the list:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]if \"apple\" in thislist:  print(\"Yes, \\'apple\\' is in the fruits list\")-----Python - Change List ItemsChange Item ValueTo change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:ExampleGet your own Python ServerChange the second item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist[1] = \"blackcurrant\"print(thislist)Change a Range of Item ValuesTo change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the newvalues, and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the newvalues:ExampleChange the values \"banana\" and \"cherry\" with the values \"blackcurrant\" and \"watermelon\":thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"mango\"]thislist[1:3] = [\"blackcurrant\", \"watermelon\"]print(thislist)If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:ExampleChange the second value by replacing it with two new values:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist[1:2] = [\"blackcurrant\", \"watermelon\"]print(thislist)Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.If you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:ExampleChange the second and third value by replacing it with one value:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist[1:3] = [\"watermelon\"]print(thislist)ADVERTISEMENTInsert ItemsTo insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:ExampleInsert \"watermelon\" as the third item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.insert(2, \"watermelon\")print(thislist)Note: As a result of the example above, the list will now contain 4 items.-----Python - Add List ItemsAppend ItemsTo add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:ExampleGet your own Python ServerUsing the append() method to append an item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.append(\"orange\")print(thislist)Insert ItemsTo insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:ExampleInsert an item as the second position:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.insert(1, \"orange\")print(thislist)Note: As a result of the examples above, the lists will now contain 4 items.ADVERTISEMENTExtend ListTo append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.ExampleAdd the elements of tropical to thislist:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]tropical = [\"mango\", \"pineapple\", \"papaya\"]thislist.extend(tropical)print(thislist)The elements will be added to the end of the list.Add Any IterableThe extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).ExampleAdd elements of a tuple to a list:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thistuple = (\"kiwi\", \"orange\")thislist.extend(thistuple)print(thislist)-----Python - Remove List ItemsRemove Specified ItemThe remove() method removes the specified item.ExampleGet your own Python ServerRemove \"banana\":thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.remove(\"banana\")print(thislist)If there are more than one item with the specified value, the remove() method removes the first occurance:ExampleRemove the first occurance of \"banana\":thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\"]thislist.remove(\"banana\")print(thislist)Remove Specified IndexThe pop() method removes the specified index.ExampleRemove the second item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.pop(1)print(thislist)If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.ExampleRemove the last item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.pop()print(thislist)The del keyword also removes the specified index:ExampleRemove the first item:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]del thislist[0]print(thislist)The del keyword can also delete the list completely.ExampleDelete the entire list:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]del thislistClear the ListThe clear() method empties the list.The list still remains, but it has no content.ExampleClear the list content:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]thislist.clear()print(thislist)-----Python - Loop ListsLoop Through a ListYou can loop through the list items by using a for loop:ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint all items in the list, one by one:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]for x in thislist:  print(x)Learn more about for loops in our Python For Loops Chapter.Loop Through the Index NumbersYou can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.ExamplePrint all items by referring to their index number:thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]for i in range(len(thislist)):  print(thislist[i])The iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2].ADVERTISEMENTUsing a While LoopYou can loop through the list items by using a while loop.Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes.Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.ExamplePrint all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbersthislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]i = 0while i ExampleWhat is the data type of a tuple?mytuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")print(type(mytuple))The tuple() ConstructorIt is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.ExampleUsing the tuple() method to make a tuple:thistuple = tuple((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) # note the double round-bracketsprint(thistuple)Python Collections (Arrays)There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.

Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.-----Python - Access Tuple ItemsAccess Tuple ItemsYou can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint the second item in the tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")print(thistuple[1])Note: The first item has index 0.Negative IndexingNegative indexing means start from the end.-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.ExamplePrint the last item of the tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")print(thistuple[-1])Range of IndexesYou can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to endthe range.When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specifieditems.ExampleReturn the third, fourth, and fifth item:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\")print(thistuple[2:5])Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).Remember that the first item has index 0.By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:ExampleThis example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT included, \"kiwi\":thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\")print(thistuple[:4])By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the tuple:ExampleThis example returns the items from \"cherry\" and to the end:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\")print(thistuple[2:])ADVERTISEMENTRange of Negative IndexesSpecify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the tuple:ExampleThis example returns the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (excluded)thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"kiwi\", \"melon\", \"mango\")print(thistuple[-4:-1])Check if Item ExistsTo determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword:ExampleCheck if \"apple\" is present in the tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")if \"apple\" in thistuple:  print(\"Yes, \\'apple\\' is in the fruits tuple\")-----Python - Update TuplesTuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.But there are some workarounds.Change Tuple ValuesOnce a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.ExampleGet your own Python ServerConvert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")y = list(x)y[1] = \"kiwi\"x = tuple(y)print(x)Add ItemsSince tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.ExampleConvert the tuple into a list, add \"orange\", and convert it back into a tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")y = list(thistuple)y.append(\"orange\")thistuple = tuple(y)2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you wantto add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:ExampleCreate a new tuple with the value \"orange\", and add that tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")y = (\"orange\",)thistuple += yprint(thistuple)Note: When creating a tuple with only one item, remember to include a comma after the item, otherwise it will not be identified as a tuple.ADVERTISEMENTRemove ItemsNote: You cannot remove items in a tuple.Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use thesame workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:ExampleConvert the tuple into a list, remove \"apple\", and convert it back into a tuple:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")y = list(thistuple)y.remove(\"apple\")thistuple = tuple(y)Or you can delete the tuple completely:ExampleThe del keyword can delete the tuple completely:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")del thistupleprint(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists-----Python - Unpack TuplesUnpacking a TupleWhen we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called \"packing\" a tuple:ExampleGet your own Python ServerPacking a tuple:fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called \"unpacking\":ExampleUnpacking a tuple:fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")(green, yellow, red) = fruitsprint(green)print(yellow)print(red)Note: The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple, if not, you must use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list.ADVERTISEMENTUsing Asterisk*If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list:ExampleAssign the rest of the values as a list called \"red\":fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"strawberry\", \"raspberry\")(green, yellow, *red) = fruitsprint(green)print(yellow)print(red)If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the numberof variables left.ExampleAdd a list of values the \"tropic\" variable:fruits = (\"apple\", \"mango\", \"papaya\", \"pineapple\", \"cherry\")(green, *tropic, red) = fruitsprint(green)print(tropic)print(red)-----Python - Loop TuplesLoop Through a TupleYou can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.ExampleGet your own Python ServerIterate through the items and print the values:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")for x in thistuple:  print(x)Learn more about for loops in our Python For Loops Chapter.Loop Through the Index NumbersYou can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index number.Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.ExamplePrint all items by referring to their index number:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")for i in range(len(thistuple)):  print(thistuple[i])ADVERTISEMENTUsing a While LoopYou can loop through the tuple items by using a while loop.Use the len() function to determine the length of the tuple, then start at 0 andloop your way through the tuple items by referring to their indexes.Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.ExamplePrint all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers:thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")i = 0while i ExampleWhat is the data type of a set?myset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"print(type(myset))The set() ConstructorIt is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.ExampleUsing the set() constructor to make a set:thisset = set((\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")) # note the double round-bracketsprint(thisset)Python Collections (Arrays)There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.

Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.-----Python - Access Set ItemsAccess ItemsYou cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.ExampleGet your own Python ServerLoop through the set, and print the values:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"for x in thisset:  print(x)ExampleCheck if \"banana\" is present in the set:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"print(\"banana\" in thisset)Change ItemsOnce a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.-----Python - Add Set ItemsAdd ItemsOnce a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.To add one item to a set use the add() method.ExampleGet your own Python ServerAdd an item to a set, using the add() method:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"thisset.add(\"orange\")print(thisset)Add SetsTo add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.ExampleAdd elements from tropical into thisset:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"tropical = \"pineapple\", \"mango\", \"papaya\"thisset.update(tropical)print(thisset)Add Any IterableThe object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).ExampleAdd elements of a list to at set:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"mylist = [\"kiwi\", \"orange\"]thisset.update(mylist)print(thisset)-----Python - Remove Set ItemsRemove ItemTo remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.ExampleGet your own Python ServerRemove \"banana\" by using the remove() method:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"thisset.remove(\"banana\")print(thisset)Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.ExampleRemove \"banana\" by using the discard() method:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"thisset.discard(\"banana\")print(thisset)Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will removea random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.ExampleRemove a random item by using the pop() method:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"x = thisset.pop()print(x)print(thisset)Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed.ExampleThe clear() method empties the set:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"thisset.clear()print(thisset)ExampleThe del keyword will delete the set completely:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"del thissetprint(thisset)-----Python - Loop SetsLoop ItemsYou can loop through the set items by using a for loop:ExampleGet your own Python ServerLoop through the set, and print the values:thisset = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"for x in thisset:  print(x)-----Python - Join SetsJoin Two SetsThere are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:ExampleGet your own Python ServerThe union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets:set1 = \"a\", \"b\" , \"c\"set2 = 1, 2, 3set3 = set1.union(set2)print(set3)ExampleThe update() method inserts the items in set2 into set1:set1 = \"a\", \"b\" , \"c\"set2 = 1, 2, 3set1.update(set2)print(set1)Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.ADVERTISEMENTKeep ONLY the DuplicatesThe intersection_update() method will keep only the items that are present in both sets.ExampleKeep the items that exist in both set x, and set y:x = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"y = \"google\", \"microsoft\", \"apple\"x.intersection_update(y)print(x)The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.ExampleReturn a set that contains the items that exist in both set x, and set y:x = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"y = \"google\", \"microsoft\", \"apple\"z = x.intersection(y)print(z)Keep All, But NOT the DuplicatesThe symmetric_difference_update() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.ExampleKeep the items that are not present in both sets:x = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"y = \"google\", \"microsoft\", \"apple\"x.symmetric_difference_update(y)print(x)The symmetric_difference() method will return a new set, that contains only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.ExampleReturn a set that contains all items from both sets, except items that are present in both:x = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"y = \"google\", \"microsoft\", \"apple\"z = x.symmetric_difference(y)print(z)Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:ExampleTrue and 1 is considered the same value:x = \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", Truey = \"google\", 1, \"apple\", 2z = x.symmetric_difference(y)print(z)-----Python -

In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate and print a dictionary:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964print(thisdict)Dictionary ItemsDictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.ExamplePrint the \"brand\" value of the dictionary:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964print(thisdict[\"brand\"])Ordered or Unordered?As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.ChangeableDictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.Duplicates Not AllowedDictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:ExampleDuplicate values will overwrite existing values:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964,  \"year\": 2020print(thisdict)ADVERTISEMENTDictionary LengthTo determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:ExamplePrint the number of items in the dictionary:print(len(thisdict))Dictionary Items - Data TypesThe values in dictionary items can be of any data type:ExampleString, int, boolean, and list data types:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"electric\": False,  \"year\": 1964,  \"colors\": [\"red\", \"white\", \"blue\"]type()From Python\\'s perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type \\'dict\\':ExamplePrint the data type of a dictionary:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964print(type(thisdict))The dict() ConstructorIt is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.ExampleUsing the dict() method to make a dictionary:thisdict = dict(name = \"John\", age = 36, country = \"Norway\")print(thisdict)Python Collections (Arrays)There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier,dictionaries are unordered.When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.-----Python - Access Dictionary ItemsAccessing ItemsYou can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:ExampleGet your own Python ServerGet the value of the \"model\" key:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964x = thisdict[\"model\"]There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:ExampleGet the value of the \"model\" key:x = thisdict.get(\"model\")Get KeysThe keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.ExampleGet a list of the keys:x = thisdict.keys()The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.ExampleAdd a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:car = \"brand\": \"Ford\",\"model\": \"Mustang\",\"year\": 1964x = car.keys()print(x) #before the changecar[\"color\"] = \"white\"print(x) #after the changeADVERTISEMENTGet ValuesThe values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.ExampleGet a list of the values:x = thisdict.values()The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.ExampleMake a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:car = \"brand\": \"Ford\",\"model\": \"Mustang\",\"year\": 1964x = car.values()print(x) #before the changecar[\"year\"] = 2020print(x) #after the changeExampleAdd a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:car = \"brand\": \"Ford\",\"model\": \"Mustang\",\"year\": 1964x = car.values()print(x) #before the changecar[\"color\"] = \"red\"print(x) #after the changeGet ItemsThe items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.ExampleGet a list of the key:value pairsx = thisdict.items()The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the items list.ExampleMake a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:car = \"brand\": \"Ford\",\"model\": \"Mustang\",\"year\": 1964x = car.items()print(x) #before the changecar[\"year\"] = 2020print(x) #after the changeExampleAdd a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:car = \"brand\": \"Ford\",\"model\": \"Mustang\",\"year\": 1964x = car.items()print(x) #before the changecar[\"color\"] = \"red\"print(x) #after the changeCheck if Key ExistsTo determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:ExampleCheck if \"model\" is present in the dictionary:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964if \"model\" in thisdict:  print(\"Yes, \\'model\\' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary\")-----Python - Change Dictionary ItemsChange ValuesYou can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:ExampleGet your own Python ServerChange the \"year\" to 2018:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict[\"year\"] = 2018Update DictionaryThe update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.ExampleUpdate the \"year\" of the car by using the update() method:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict.update(\"year\": 2020)-----Python - Add Dictionary ItemsAdding ItemsAdding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:ExampleGet your own Python Serverthisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict[\"color\"] = \"red\"print(thisdict)Update DictionaryThe update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. If the item does not exist, the item will be added.The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.ExampleAdd a color item to the dictionary by using the update() method:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict.update(\"color\": \"red\")-----Python - Remove Dictionary ItemsRemoving ItemsThere are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:ExampleGet your own Python ServerThe pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict.pop(\"model\")print(thisdict)ExampleThe popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict.popitem()print(thisdict)ExampleThe del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964del thisdict[\"model\"]print(thisdict)ExampleThe del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964del thisdictprint(thisdict) #this will cause an error because \"thisdict\" no longer exists.ExampleThe clear() method empties the dictionary:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964thisdict.clear()print(thisdict)-----Python - Loop DictionariesLoop Through a DictionaryYou can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint all key names in the dictionary, one by one:for x in thisdict:  print(x)ExamplePrint all values in the dictionary, one by one:for x in thisdict:  print(thisdict[x])ExampleYou can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:for x in thisdict.values():  print(x)ExampleYou can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:for x in thisdict.keys():  print(x)ExampleLoop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:for x, y in thisdict.items():  print(x, y)-----Python - Copy DictionariesCopy a DictionaryYou cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 willonly be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().ExampleGet your own Python ServerMake a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964mydict = thisdict.copy()print(mydict)Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().ExampleMake a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:thisdict =   \"brand\": \"Ford\",  \"model\": \"Mustang\",  \"year\": 1964mydict = dict(thisdict)print(mydict)-----Python - Nested DictionariesNested DictionariesA dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:myfamily =   \"child1\" :     \"name\" : \"Emil\",    \"year\" : 2004  ,  \"child2\" :     \"name\" : \"Tobias\",    \"year\" : 2007  ,  \"child3\" :     \"name\" : \"Linus\",    \"year\" : 2011  Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:ExampleCreate three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:child1 =   \"name\" : \"Emil\",  \"year\" : 2004child2 =   \"name\" : \"Tobias\",  \"year\" : 2007child3 =   \"name\" : \"Linus\",  \"year\" : 2011myfamily =   \"child1\" : child1,  \"child2\" : child2,  \"child3\" : child3Access Items in Nested DictionariesTo access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary:ExamplePrint the name of child 2:print(myfamily[\"child2\"][\"name\"])-----Python Dictionary MethodsDictionary MethodsPython has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.MethodDescriptionclear()Removes all the elements from the dictionarycopy()Returns a copy of the dictionaryfromkeys()Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and valueget()Returns the value of the specified keyitems()Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pairkeys()Returns a list containing the dictionary\\'s keyspop()Removes the element with the specified keypopitem()Removes the last inserted key-value pairsetdefault() Returns the value of the specified key.

ElsePython Conditions and If statementsPython supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:Equals: a == bNot Equals: a != bLess than: a  bGreater than or equal to: a >= bThese conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in \"if statements\" and loops.An \"if statement\" is written by using the if keyword.ExampleGet your own Python ServerIf statement:a = 33b = 200if b > a:  print(\"b is greater than a\")In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we knowthat 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that \"b is greater than a\".IndentationPython relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for thispurpose.ExampleIf statement, without indentation (will raise an error):a = 33b = 200if b > a:print(\"b is greater than a\") # you will get an errorADVERTISEMENTElifThe elif keyword is Python\\'s way of saying \"if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition\".Examplea = 33b = 33if b > a:  print(\"b is greater than a\")elif a == b:  print(\"a and b are equal\")In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that \"a and b are equal\".ElseThe else keyword catches anything which isn\\'t caught by the preceding conditions.Examplea = 200b = 33if b > a:  print(\"b is greater than a\")elif a == b:  print(\"a and b are equal\")else:  print(\"a is greater than b\")In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that \"a is greater than b\".You can also have an else without the elif:Examplea = 200b = 33if b > a:  print(\"b is greater than a\")else:  print(\"b is not greater than a\")Short Hand IfIf you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.ExampleOne line if statement:if a > b: print(\"a is greater than b\")Short Hand If ... ElseIf you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you canput it all on the same line:ExampleOne line if else statement:a = 2b = 330print(\"A\") if a > b else print(\"B\")This technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions.You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:ExampleOne line if else statement, with 3 conditions:a = 330b = 330print(\"A\") if a > b else print(\"=\") if a == b else print(\"B\")AndThe and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:ExampleTest if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:a = 200b = 33c = 500if a > b and c > a:  print(\"Both conditions are True\")OrThe or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:ExampleTest if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:a = 200b = 33c = 500if a > b or a > c:  print(\"At least one of the conditions is True\")NotThe not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:ExampleTest if a is NOT greater than b:a = 33b = 200if not a > b:  print(\"a is NOT greater than b\")Nested IfYou can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.Examplex = 41if x > 10:  print(\"Above ten,\")  if x > 20:    print(\"and also above 20!\")  else:    print(\"but not above 20.\")The pass Statementif statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.Examplea = 33b = 200if b > a:  pass-----Python While LoopsPython LoopsPython has two primitive loop commands:while loopsfor loopsThe while LoopWith the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition istrue.ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint i as long as i is less than 6:i = 1while i  0):    result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)    print(result)  else:    result = 0  return resultprint(\"\\\\n\\\\nRecursion Example Results\")tri_recursion(6)-----Python LambdaA lambda function is a small anonymous function.A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.Syntaxlambda arguments : expressionThe expression is executed and the result is returned:ExampleGet your own Python ServerAdd 10 to argument a, and return the result:x = lambda a : a + 10print(x(5))Lambda functions can take any number of arguments:ExampleMultiply argument a with argument b and return the result:x = lambda a, b : a * bprint(x(5, 6))ExampleSummarize argument a, b, and c and return the result:x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + cprint(x(5, 6, 2))ADVERTISEMENTWhy Use Lambda Functions?The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:def myfunc(n):  return lambda a : a * nUse that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:Exampledef myfunc(n):  return lambda a : a * nmydoubler = myfunc(2)print(mydoubler(11))Or, use the same function definition to make a function that always triples the number you send in:Exampledef myfunc(n):  return lambda a : a * nmytripler = myfunc(3)print(mytripler(11))Or, use the same function definition to make both functions, in the same program:Exampledef myfunc(n):  return lambda a : a * nmydoubler = myfunc(2)mytripler = myfunc(3)print(mydoubler(11)) print(mytripler(11))Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.-----Python ArraysNote: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.ArraysNote: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate an array containing car names:cars = [\"Ford\", \"Volvo\", \"BMW\"]What is an Array?An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the carsin single variables could look like this:car1 = \"Ford\"car2 = \"Volvo\"car3 = \"BMW\"However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?The solution is an array!An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the valuesby referring to an index number.Access the Elements of an ArrayYou refer to an array element by referring to the index number.ExampleGet the value of the first array item:x = cars[0]ExampleModify the value of the first array item:cars[0] = \"Toyota\"The Length of an ArrayUse the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements inan array).ExampleReturn the number of elements in the cars array:x = len(cars)Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.ADVERTISEMENTLooping Array ElementsYou can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.ExamplePrint each item in the cars array:for x in cars:  print(x)Adding Array ElementsYou can use the append() method to add an element to an array.ExampleAdd one more element to the cars array:cars.append(\"Honda\")Removing Array ElementsYou can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.ExampleDelete the second element of the cars array:cars.pop(1)You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.ExampleDelete the element that has the value \"Volvo\":cars.remove(\"Volvo\")Note: The list\\'s remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value.Array MethodsPython has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.MethodDescriptionappend()Adds an element at the end of the listclear()Removes all the elements from the listcopy()Returns a copy of the listcount()Returns the number of elements with the specified valueextend()Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current listindex()Returns the index of the first element with the specified valueinsert()Adds an element at the specified positionpop()Removes the element at the specified positionremove()Removes the first item with the specified valuereverse()Reverses the order of the listsort()Sorts the listNote: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.-----Python Classes and ObjectsPython Classes/ObjectsPython is an object oriented programming language.Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.Create a ClassTo create a class, use the keyword class:ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a class named MyClass, with a property named x:class MyClass:  x = 5Create ObjectNow we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:ExampleCreate an object named p1, and print the value of x:p1 = MyClass()print(p1.x)The __init__() FunctionThe examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when theclass is being initiated.Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:ExampleCreate a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:class Person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    self.name = name    self.age = agep1 = Person(\"John\", 36)print(p1.name)print(p1.age)Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.ADVERTISEMENTThe __str__() FunctionThe __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object isrepresented as a string.If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object isreturned:ExampleThe string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function:class Person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    self.name = name    self.age = agep1 = Person(\"John\", 36)print(p1)ExampleThe string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function:class Person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    self.name = name    self.age = age  def __str__(self):    return f\"self.name(self.age)\"p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)print(p1)Object MethodsObjects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.Let us create a method in the Person class:ExampleInsert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:class Person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    self.name = name    self.age = age  def myfunc(self):    print(\"Hello my name is \" + self.name)p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)p1.myfunc()Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.The self ParameterThe self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:ExampleUse the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:class Person:  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):    mysillyobject.name = name    mysillyobject.age = age  def myfunc(abc):    print(\"Hello my name is \" + abc.name)p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)p1.myfunc()Modify Object PropertiesYou can modify properties on objects like this:ExampleSet the age of p1 to 40:p1.age = 40Delete Object PropertiesYou can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:ExampleDelete the age property from the p1 object:del p1.ageDelete ObjectsYou can delete objects by using the del keyword:ExampleDelete the p1 object:del p1The pass Statementclass definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.Exampleclass Person:  pass-----Python InheritancePython InheritanceInheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.Create a Parent ClassAny class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any otherclass:ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:class Person:  def __init__(self, fname, lname):    self.firstname = fname    self.lastname = lname  def printname(self):    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:x = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")x.printname()Create a Child ClassTo create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:ExampleCreate a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods fromthe Person class:class Student(Person):  passNote: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class.Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person class.ExampleUse the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:x = Student(\"Mike\", \"Olsen\")x.printname()ADVERTISEMENTAdd the __init__() FunctionSo far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.ExampleAdd the __init__() function to the Student class:class Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname):    #add properties etc.When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit theparent\\'s __init__() function.Note: The child\\'s __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent\\'s __init__() function.To keep the inheritance of the parent\\'s __init__() function, add a call to the parent\\'s __init__() function:Exampleclass Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname):    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the inheritanceof the parent class, and we are ready to add functionality in the __init__() function.Use the super() FunctionPython also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:Exampleclass Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname):    super().__init__(fname, lname)By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.Add PropertiesExampleAdd a property called graduationyear to the Student class:class Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname):    super().__init__(fname, lname)    self.graduationyear = 2019In the example below, the year 2019 should be a variable, and passed into the Student class when creating student objects. To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:ExampleAdd a year parameter, and pass the correct year when creating objects:class Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):    super().__init__(fname, lname)    self.graduationyear = yearx = Student(\"Mike\", \"Olsen\", 2019)Add MethodsExampleAdd a method called welcome to the Student class:class Student(Person):  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):    super().__init__(fname, lname)    self.graduationyear = year  def welcome(self):    print(\"Welcome\", self.firstname, self.lastname, \"to the class of\", self.graduationyear)If you add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in the parent class, the inheritance of the parent method will be overridden.-----Python IteratorsPython IteratorsAn iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().Iterator vs IterableLists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:ExampleGet your own Python ServerReturn an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:mytuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")myit = iter(mytuple)print(next(myit))print(next(myit))print(next(myit))Even strings are iterable objects, and can return an iterator:ExampleStrings are also iterable objects, containing a sequence of characters:mystr = \"banana\"myit = iter(mystr)print(next(myit))print(next(myit))print(next(myit))print(next(myit))print(next(myit))print(next(myit))Looping Through an IteratorWe can also use a for loop to iterate through an iterable object:ExampleIterate the values of a tuple:mytuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")for x in mytuple:  print(x)ExampleIterate the characters of a string:mystr = \"banana\"for x in mystr:  print(x)The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop.ADVERTISEMENTCreate an IteratorTo create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the nextitem in the sequence.ExampleCreate an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence willincrease by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):class MyNumbers:  def __iter__(self):    self.a = 1    return self  def __next__(self):    x = self.a    self.a += 1    return xmyclass = MyNumbers()myiter = iter(myclass)print(next(myiter))print(next(myiter))print(next(myiter))print(next(myiter))print(next(myiter))StopIterationThe example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, orif it was used in a for loop.To prevent the iteration from going on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:ExampleStop after 20 iterations:class MyNumbers:  def __iter__(self):    self.a = 1    return self  def __next__(self):    if self.a pip

for errors.The except block lets you handle the error.The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.Exception HandlingWhen an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.These exceptions can be handled using the try statement:ExampleGet your own Python ServerThe try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined:try:  print(x)except:  print(\"An exception occurred\")Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed.Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error:ExampleThis statement will raise an error, because x is not defined:print(x)Many ExceptionsYou can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to executea special block of code for a special kind of error:ExamplePrint one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors:try:  print(x)except NameError:  print(\"Variable x is not defined\")except:  print(\"Something else went wrong\")ADVERTISEMENTElseYou can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:ExampleIn this example, the try block does not generate any error:try:  print(\"Hello\")except:  print(\"Something went wrong\")else:  print(\"Nothing went wrong\")FinallyThe finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.Exampletry:  print(x)except:  print(\"Something went wrong\")finally:  print(\"The \\'try except\\' is finished\")This can be useful to close objects and clean up resources:ExampleTry to open and write to a file that is not writable:try:  f = open(\"demofile.txt\")  try:    f.write(\"Lorum Ipsum\")  except:    print(\"Something went wrong when writing to the file\")  finally:    f.close()except:  print(\"Something went wrong when opening the file\")The program can continue, without leaving the file object open.Raise an exceptionAs a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.ExampleRaise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0:x = -1if x pip install numpyIf this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has NumPy installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.Import NumPyOnce NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:import numpyNow NumPy is imported and ready to use.ExampleGet your own Python Serverimport numpy arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) print(arr)NumPy as npNumPy is usually imported under the np alias.alias: In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing.Create an alias with the as keyword while importing:import numpy as npNow the NumPy package can be referred to as np instead of numpy.Exampleimport numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) print(arr)Checking NumPy VersionThe version string is stored under __version__ attribute.Exampleimport numpy as npprint(np.__version__)-----NumPy Creating ArraysCreate a NumPy ndarray ObjectNumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.ExampleGet your own Python Serverimport numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])print(arr)print(type(arr))type(): This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it. Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray:ExampleUse a tuple to create a NumPy array:import numpy as np arr = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))print(arr)Dimensions in ArraysA dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.ADVERTISEMENT0-D Arrays0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.ExampleCreate a 0-D array with value 42import numpy as nparr = np.array(42)print(arr)1-D ArraysAn array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.These are the most common and basic arrays.ExampleCreate a 1-D array containing the values 1,2,3,4,5:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])print(arr)2-D ArraysAn array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.NumPy has a whole sub module dedicated towards matrix operations called numpy.matExampleCreate a 2-D array containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])print(arr)3-D arraysAn array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor.ExampleCreate a 3-D array with two 2-D arrays, both containing two arrays with the values 1,2,3 and 4,5,6:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])print(arr)Check Number of Dimensions?NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.ExampleCheck how many dimensions the arrays have:import numpy as npa = np.array(42)b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])print(a.ndim) print(b.ndim) print(c.ndim) print(d.ndim)Higher Dimensional ArraysAn array can have any number of dimensions.When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument.ExampleCreate an array with 5 dimensions and verify that it has 5 dimensions:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)print(arr)print(\\'number of dimensions :\\', arr.ndim)In this array the innermost dimension (5th dim) has 4 elements, the 4th dim has 1 element that is the vector, the 3rd dim has 1 element that is the matrix with the vector, the 2nd dim has 1 element that is 3D array and 1st dim has 1 elementthat is a 4D array.-----NumPy Array IndexingAccess Array ElementsArray indexing is the same as accessing an array element.You can access an array element by referring to its index number.The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGet the first element from the following array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])print(arr[0])ExampleGet the second element from the following array.import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])print(arr[1])ExampleGet third and fourth elements from the following array and add them.import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])print(arr[2] + arr[3])ADVERTISEMENTAccess 2-D ArraysTo access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.ExampleAccess the element on the first row, second column:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])print(\\'2nd element on 1st row: \\', arr[0, 1])ExampleAccess the element on the 2nd row, 5th column:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])print(\\'5th element on 2nd row: \\', arr[1, 4])Access 3-D ArraysTo access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimensions and the index of the element.ExampleAccess the third element of the second array of the first array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])print(arr[0, 1, 2])Example Explainedarr[0, 1, 2] prints the value 6.And this is why:The first number represents the first dimension, which contains two arrays:[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]and:[[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]Since we selected 0, we are left with the first array:[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]The second number represents the second dimension, which also contains two arrays:[1, 2, 3]and:[4, 5, 6]Since we selected 1, we are left with the second array:[4, 5, 6]The third number represents the third dimension, which contains three values:456Since we selected 2, we end up with the third value:6Negative IndexingUse negative indexing to access an array from the end.ExamplePrint the last element from the 2nd dim:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])print(\\'Last element from 2nd dim: \\', arr[1, -1])-----NumPy Array SlicingSlicing arraysSlicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].If we don\\'t pass start its considered 0If we don\\'t pass end its considered length of array in that dimensionIf we don\\'t pass step its considered 1ExampleGet your own Python ServerSlice elements from index 1 to index 5 from the following array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[1:5])Note: The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index.ExampleSlice elements from index 4 to the end of the array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[4:])ExampleSlice elements from the beginning to index 4 (not included):import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[:4])ADVERTISEMENTNegative SlicingUse the minus operator to refer to an index from the end:ExampleSlice from the index 3 from the end to index 1 from the end:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[-3:-1])STEPUse the step value to determine the step of the slicing:ExampleReturn every other element from index 1 to index 5:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[1:5:2])ExampleReturn every other element from the entire array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])print(arr[::2])Slicing 2-D ArraysExampleFrom the second element, slice elements from index 1 to index 4 (not included):import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])print(arr[1, 1:4])Note: Remember that second element has index 1.ExampleFrom both elements, return index 2:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])print(arr[0:2, 2])ExampleFrom both elements, slice index 1 to index 4 (not included), this will return a 2-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])print(arr[0:2, 1:4])-----NumPy Data TypesData Types in PythonBy default Python have these data types:strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g.\"ABCD\"integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42boolean - used to represent True or False.complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5jData Types in NumPyNumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.i - integerb - booleanu - unsigned integerf - floatc - complex floatm - timedeltaM - datetimeO - objectS - stringU - unicode stringV - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )Checking the Data Type of an ArrayThe NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type ofthe array:ExampleGet your own Python ServerGet the data type of an array object:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])print(arr.dtype)ExampleGet the data type of an array containing strings:import numpy as nparr = np.array([\\'apple\\', \\'banana\\', \\'cherry\\'])print(arr.dtype)ADVERTISEMENTCreating Arrays With a Defined Data TypeWe use the array() function to create arrays, this function can take an optionalargument: dtype that allows us to define the expected data type of the array elements:ExampleCreate an array with data type string:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=\\'S\\')print(arr)print(arr.dtype)For i, u, f, S and U we can define size as well.ExampleCreate an array with data type 4 bytes integer:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=\\'i4\\')print(arr)print(arr.dtype)What if a Value Can Not Be Converted?If a type is given in which elements can\\'t be casted then NumPy will raise a ValueError.ValueError: In Python ValueError is raised when the type of passed argument to afunction is unexpected/incorrect.ExampleA non integer string like \\'a\\' can not be converted to integer (will raise an error):import numpy as nparr = np.array([\\'a\\', \\'2\\', \\'3\\'], dtype=\\'i\\')Converting Data Type on Existing ArraysThe best way to change the data type of an existing array, is to make a copy of the array with the astype() method.The astype() function creates a copy of the array, and allows you to specify thedata type as a parameter.The data type can be specified using a string, like \\'f\\' for float, \\'i\\' for integer etc. or you can use the data type directly like float for float and int for integer.ExampleChange data type from float to integer by using \\'i\\' as parameter value:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])newarr = arr.astype(\\'i\\')print(newarr)print(newarr.dtype)ExampleChange data type from float to integer by using int as parameter value:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])newarr = arr.astype(int)print(newarr)print(newarr.dtype)ExampleChange data type from integer to boolean:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 0, 3])newarr = arr.astype(bool)print(newarr)print(newarr.dtype)-----NumPy Array Copy vs ViewThe Difference Between Copy and ViewThe main difference between a copy and a view of an array is that the copy is a new array, and the view is just a view of the original array.The copy owns the data and any changes made to the copy will not affect originalarray, and any changes made to the original array will not affect the copy.The view does not own the data and any changes made to the view will affect the original array, and any changes made to the original array will affect the view.COPY:ExampleGet your own Python ServerMake a copy, change the original array, and display both arrays:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])x = arr.copy()arr[0] = 42print(arr) print(x)The copy SHOULD NOT be affected by the changes made to the original array.VIEW:ExampleMake a view, change the original array, and display both arrays:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])x = arr.view()arr[0] = 42print(arr) print(x)The view SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the original array.Make Changes in the VIEW:ExampleMake a view, change the view, and display both arrays:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])x = arr.view()x[0] = 31print(arr) print(x)The original array SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the view.ADVERTISEMENTCheck if Array Owns its DataAs mentioned above, copies owns the data, and views does not own the data, but how can we check this?Every NumPy array has the attribute base that returns None if the array owns thedata.Otherwise, the base  attribute refers to the original object.ExamplePrint the value of the base attribute to check if an array owns it\\'s data or not:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])x = arr.copy()y = arr.view()print(x.base)print(y.base)The copy returns None.The view returns the original array.-----NumPy Array ShapeShape of an ArrayThe shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.Get the Shape of an ArrayNumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each indexhaving the number of corresponding elements.ExampleGet your own Python ServerPrint the shape of a 2-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])print(arr.shape)The example above returns (2, 4), which means that the array has 2 dimensions, where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4.ExampleCreate an array with 5 dimensions using ndmin using a vector with values 1,2,3,4and verify that last dimension has value 4:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)print(arr)print(\\'shape of array :\\', arr.shape)What does the shape tuple represent?Integers at every index tells about the number of elements the corresponding dimension has.In the example above at index-4 we have value 4, so we can say that 5th ( 4 + 1 th) dimension has 4 elements.-----NumPy Array ReshapingReshaping arraysReshaping means changing the shape of an array.The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.By reshaping we can add or remove dimensions or change number of elements in each dimension.Reshape From 1-D to 2-DExampleGet your own Python ServerConvert the following 1-D array with 12 elements into a 2-D array.The outermost dimension will have 4 arrays, each with 3 elements:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])newarr = arr.reshape(4, 3)print(newarr)Reshape From 1-D to 3-DExampleConvert the following 1-D array with 12 elements into a 3-D array.The outermost dimension will have 2 arrays that contains 3 arrays, each with 2 elements:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])newarr = arr.reshape(2, 3, 2)print(newarr)ADVERTISEMENTCan We Reshape Into any Shape?Yes, as long as the elements required for reshaping are equal in both shapes.We can reshape an 8 elements 1D array into 4 elements in 2 rows 2D array but we cannot reshape it into a 3 elements 3 rows 2D array as that would require 3x3 = 9 elements.ExampleTry converting 1D array with 8 elements to a 2D array with 3 elements in each dimension (will raise an error):import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])newarr = arr.reshape(3, 3)print(newarr)Returns Copy or View?ExampleCheck if the returned array is a copy or a view:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])print(arr.reshape(2, 4).base)The example above returns the original array, so it is a view.Unknown DimensionYou are allowed to have one \"unknown\" dimension.Meaning that you do not have to specify an exact number for one of the dimensions in the reshape method.Pass -1 as the value, and NumPy will calculate this number for you.ExampleConvert 1D array with 8 elements to 3D array with 2x2 elements:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])newarr = arr.reshape(2, 2, -1)print(newarr)Note: We can not pass -1 to more than one dimension.Flattening the arraysFlattening array means converting a multidimensional array into a 1D array.We can use reshape(-1) to do this.ExampleConvert the array into a 1D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])newarr = arr.reshape(-1)print(newarr)Note: There are a lot of functions for changing the shapes of arrays in numpy flatten, ravel and also for rearranging the elements rot90, flip, fliplr, flipudetc. These fall under Intermediate to Advanced section of numpy.-----NumPy Array IteratingIterating ArraysIterating means going through elements one by one.As we deal with multi-dimensional arrays in numpy, we can do this using basic for loop of python.If we iterate on a 1-D array it will go through each element one by one.ExampleGet your own Python ServerIterate on the elements of the following 1-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3])for x in arr:  print(x)Iterating 2-D ArraysIn a 2-D array it will go through all the rows.ExampleIterate on the elements of the following 2-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])for x in arr:  print(x)If we iterate on a n-D array it will go through n-1th dimension one by one.To return the actual values, the scalars, we have to iterate the arrays in each dimension.ExampleIterate on each scalar element of the 2-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])for x in arr:  for y in x:    print(y)ADVERTISEMENTIterating 3-D ArraysIn a 3-D array it will go through all the 2-D arrays.ExampleIterate on the elements of the following 3-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])for x in arr:  print(x)To return the actual values, the scalars, we have to iterate the arrays in each dimension.ExampleIterate down to the scalars:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])for x in arr:  for y in x:    for z in y:      print(z)Iterating Arrays Using nditer()The function nditer() is a helping function that can be used from very basic to very advanced iterations. It solves some basic issues which we face in iteration, lets go through it with examples.Iterating on Each Scalar ElementIn basic for loops, iterating through each scalar of an array we need to use n for loops which can be difficult to write for arrays with very high dimensionality.ExampleIterate through the following 3-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])for x in np.nditer(arr):  print(x)Iterating Array With Different Data TypesWe can use op_dtypes argument and pass it the expected datatype to change the datatype of elements while iterating.NumPy does not change the data type of the element in-place (where the element is in array) so it needs some other space to perform this action, that extra space is called buffer, and in order to enable it in nditer() we pass flags=[\\'buffered\\'].ExampleIterate through the array as a string:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3])for x in np.nditer(arr, flags=[\\'buffered\\'], op_dtypes=[\\'S\\']):  print(x)Iterating With Different Step SizeWe can use filtering and followed by iteration.ExampleIterate through every scalar element of the 2D array skipping 1 element:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])for x in np.nditer(arr[:, ::2]):  print(x)Enumerated Iteration Using ndenumerate()Enumeration means mentioning sequence number of somethings one by one.Sometimes we require corresponding index of the element while iterating, the ndenumerate() method can be used for those usecases.ExampleEnumerate on following 1D arrays elements:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3])for idx, x in np.ndenumerate(arr):  print(idx, x)ExampleEnumerate on following 2D array\\'s elements:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])for idx, x in np.ndenumerate(arr):  print(idx, x)-----NumPy Joining ArrayJoining NumPy ArraysJoining means putting contents of two or more arrays in a single array.In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes.We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the concatenate() function,along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0.ExampleGet your own Python ServerJoin two arraysimport numpy as nparr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))print(arr)ExampleJoin two 2-D arrays along rows (axis=1):import numpy as nparr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=1)print(arr)Joining Arrays Using Stack FunctionsStacking is same as concatenation, the only difference is that stacking is done along a new axis.We can concatenate two 1-D arrays along the second axis which would result in putting them one over the other, ie. stacking.We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the stack() method along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed it is taken as 0.Exampleimport numpy as nparr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])arr = np.stack((arr1, arr2), axis=1)print(arr)ADVERTISEMENTStacking Along RowsNumPy provides a helper function: hstack() to stack along rows.Exampleimport numpy as nparr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])arr = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))print(arr)Stacking Along ColumnsNumPy provides a helper function: vstack()  to stack along columns.Exampleimport numpy as nparr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])arr = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))print(arr)Stacking Along Height (depth)NumPy provides a helper function: dstack() to stack along height, which is the same as depth.Exampleimport numpy as nparr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])arr = np.dstack((arr1, arr2))print(arr)-----NumPy Splitting ArraySplitting NumPy ArraysSplitting is reverse operation of Joining.Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to splitand the number of splits.ExampleGet your own Python ServerSplit the array in 3 parts:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3)print(newarr)Note: The return value is a list containing three arrays.If the array has less elements than required, it will adjust from the end accordingly.ExampleSplit the array in 4 parts:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 4)print(newarr)Note: We also have the method split() available but it will not adjust the elements when elements are less in source array for splitting like in example above, array_split() worked properly but split() would fail.ADVERTISEMENTSplit Into ArraysThe return value of the array_split() method is an array containing each of the split as an array.If you split an array into 3 arrays, you can access them from the result just like any array element:ExampleAccess the splitted arrays:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3)print(newarr[0])print(newarr[1])print(newarr[2])Splitting 2-D ArraysUse the same syntax when splitting 2-D arrays.Use the array_split() method, pass in the array you want to split and the numberof splits you want to do.ExampleSplit the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays.import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3)print(newarr)The example above returns three 2-D arrays.Let\\'s look at another example, this time each element in the 2-D arrays contains3 elements.ExampleSplit the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays.import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3)print(newarr)The example above returns three 2-D arrays.In addition, you can specify which axis you want to do the split around.The example below also returns three 2-D arrays, but they are split along the row (axis=1).ExampleSplit the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along rows.import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3, axis=1)print(newarr)An alternate solution is using hsplit() opposite of hstack()ExampleUse the hsplit() method to split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along rows.import numpy as nparr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])newarr = np.hsplit(arr, 3)print(newarr)Note: Similar alternates to vstack() and dstack() are available as vsplit() and dsplit().-----NumPy Searching ArraysSearching ArraysYou can search an array for a certain value, and return the indexes that get a match.To search an array, use the where() method.ExampleGet your own Python ServerFind the indexes where the value is 4:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4])x = np.where(arr == 4)print(x)The example above will return a tuple: (array([3, 5, 6],)Which means that the value 4 is present at index 3, 5, and 6.ExampleFind the indexes where the values are even:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])x = np.where(arr%2 == 0)print(x)ExampleFind the indexes where the values are odd:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])x = np.where(arr%2 == 1)print(x)ADVERTISEMENTSearch SortedThere is a method called searchsorted() which performs a binary search in the array, and returns the index where the specified value would be inserted to maintain the search order.The searchsorted() method is assumed to be used on sorted arrays.ExampleFind the indexes where the value 7 should be inserted:import numpy as nparr = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9])x = np.searchsorted(arr, 7)print(x)Example explained: The number 7 should be inserted on index 1 to remain the sortorder.The method starts the search from the left and returns the first index where thenumber 7 is no longer larger than the next value.Search From the Right SideBy default the left most index is returned, but we can give side=\\'right\\' to return the right most index instead.ExampleFind the indexes where the value 7 should be inserted, starting from the right:import numpy as nparr = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9])x = np.searchsorted(arr, 7, side=\\'right\\')print(x)Example explained: The number 7 should be inserted on index 2 to remain the sortorder.The method starts the search from the right and returns the first index where the number 7 is no longer less than the next value.Multiple ValuesTo search for more than one value, use an array with the specified values.ExampleFind the indexes where the values 2, 4, and 6 should be inserted:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7])x = np.searchsorted(arr, [2, 4, 6])print(x)The return value is an array: [1 2 3] containing the three indexes where 2, 4, 6would be inserted in the original array to maintain the order.-----NumPy Sorting ArraysSorting ArraysSorting means putting elements in an ordered sequence.Ordered sequence is any sequence that has an order corresponding to elements, like numeric or alphabetical, ascending or descending.The NumPy ndarray object has a function called sort(), that will sort a specified array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerSort the array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([3, 2, 0, 1])print(np.sort(arr))Note: This method returns a copy of the array, leaving the original array unchanged.You can also sort arrays of strings, or any other data type:ExampleSort the array alphabetically:import numpy as nparr = np.array([\\'banana\\', \\'cherry\\', \\'apple\\'])print(np.sort(arr))ExampleSort a boolean array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([True, False, True])print(np.sort(arr))Sorting a 2-D ArrayIf you use the sort() method on a 2-D array, both arrays will be sorted:ExampleSort a 2-D array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([[3, 2, 4], [5, 0, 1]])print(np.sort(arr))-----NumPy Filter ArrayFiltering ArraysGetting some elements out of an existing array and creating a new array out of them is called filtering.In NumPy, you filter an array using a boolean index list.A boolean index list is a list of booleans corresponding to indexes in the array.If the value at an index is True that element is contained in the filtered array, if the value at that index is False that element is excluded from the filtered array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate an array from the elements on index 0 and 2:import numpy as nparr = np.array([41, 42, 43, 44])x = [True, False, True, False]newarr = arr[x]print(newarr)The example above will return [41, 43], why?Because the new array contains only the values where the filter array had the value True, in this case, index 0 and 2.Creating the Filter ArrayIn the example above we hard-coded the True and False values, but the common useis to create a filter array based on conditions.ExampleCreate a filter array that will return only values higher than 42:import numpy as nparr = np.array([41, 42, 43, 44])# Create an empty listfilter_arr = []# go through each element in arrfor element in arr:  # if the element is higher than 42, set the value to True, otherwise False:  if element > 42:    filter_arr.append(True)  else:    filter_arr.append(False)newarr = arr[filter_arr]print(filter_arr)print(newarr)ADVERTISEMENTExampleCreate a filter array that will return only even elements from the original array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])# Create an empty listfilter_arr = []# go through each element in arrfor element in arr:  # if the element is completely divisble by 2, set the value to True, otherwiseFalse  if element % 2 == 0:    filter_arr.append(True)  else:    filter_arr.append(False)newarr = arr[filter_arr]print(filter_arr)print(newarr)Creating Filter Directly From ArrayThe above example is quite a common task in NumPy and NumPy provides a nice way to tackle it.We can directly substitute the array instead of the iterable variable in our condition and it will work just as we expect it to.ExampleCreate a filter array that will return only values higher than 42:import numpy as nparr = np.array([41, 42, 43, 44])filter_arr = arr > 42newarr = arr[filter_arr]print(filter_arr)print(newarr)ExampleCreate a filter array that will return only even elements from the original array:import numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])filter_arr = arr % 2 == 0newarr = arr[filter_arr]print(filter_arr)print(newarr)-----Random Numbers in NumPyWhat is a Random Number?Random number does NOT mean a different number every time. Random means something that can not be predicted logically.Pseudo Random and True Random.Computers work on programs, and programs are definitive set of instructions. So it means there must be some algorithm to generate a random number as well.If there is a program to generate random number it can be predicted, thus it is not truly random.Random numbers generated through a generation algorithm are called pseudo random.Can we make truly random numbers?Yes. In order to generate a truly random number on our computers we need to get the random data from some outside source. This outside source is generally our keystrokes, mouse movements, data on network etc.We do not need truly random numbers, unless it is related to security (e.g. encryption keys) or the basis of application is the randomness (e.g. Digital roulette wheels).In this tutorial we will be using pseudo random numbers.Generate Random NumberNumPy offers the random module to work with random numbers.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGenerate a random integer from 0 to 100:from numpy import randomx = random.randint(100)print(x)Generate Random FloatThe random module\\'s rand() method returns a random float between 0 and 1.ExampleGenerate a random float from 0 to 1:from numpy import randomx = random.rand()print(x)ADVERTISEMENTGenerate Random ArrayIn NumPy we work with arrays, and you can use the two methods from the above examples to make random arrays.IntegersThe randint() method takes a size parameter where you can specify the shape of an array.ExampleGenerate a 1-D array containing 5 random integers from 0 to 100:from numpy import randomx=random.randint(100, size=(5))print(x)ExampleGenerate a 2-D array with 3 rows, each row containing 5 random integers from 0 to 100:from numpy import randomx = random.randint(100, size=(3, 5))print(x)FloatsThe rand() method also allows you to specify the shape of the array.ExampleGenerate a 1-D array containing 5 random floats:from numpy import randomx = random.rand(5)print(x)ExampleGenerate a 2-D array with 3 rows, each row containing 5 random numbers:from numpy import randomx = random.rand(3, 5)print(x)Generate Random Number From ArrayThe choice() method allows you to generate a random value based on an array of values.The choice() method takes an array as a parameter and randomly returns one of the values.ExampleReturn one of the values in an array:from numpy import randomx = random.choice([3, 5, 7, 9])print(x)The choice() method also allows you to return an array of values.Add a size parameter to specify the shape of the array.ExampleGenerate a 2-D array that consists of the values in the array parameter (3, 5, 7, and 9):from numpy import randomx = random.choice([3, 5, 7, 9], size=(3, 5))print(x)-----Random Data DistributionWhat is Data Distribution?Data Distribution is a list of all possible values, and how often each value occurs.Such lists are important when working with statistics and data science.The random module offer methods that returns randomly generated data distributions.Random DistributionA random distribution is a set of random numbers that follow a certain probability density function.Probability Density Function: A function that describes a continuous probability. i.e. probability of all values in an array.We can generate random numbers based on defined probabilities using the choice()method of the random module.The choice() method allows us to specify the probability for each value.The probability is set by a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the valuewill never occur and 1 means that the value will always occur.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGenerate a 1-D array containing 100 values, where each value has to be 3, 5, 7 or 9.The probability for the value to be 3 is set to be 0.1The probability for the value to be 5 is set to be 0.3The probability for the value to be 7 is set to be 0.6The probability for the value to be 9 is set to be 0from numpy import randomx = random.choice([3, 5, 7, 9], p=[0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0], size=(100))print(x)The sum of all probability numbers should be 1.Even if you run the example above 100 times, the value 9 will never occur.You can return arrays of any shape and size by specifying the shape in the size parameter.ExampleSame example as above, but return a 2-D array with 3 rows, each containing 5 values.from numpy import randomx = random.choice([3, 5, 7, 9], p=[0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0], size=(3, 5))print(x)-----Random PermutationsRandom Permutations of ElementsA permutation refers to an arrangement of elements. e.g. [3, 2, 1] is a permutation of [1, 2, 3] and vice-versa.The NumPy Random module provides two methods for this: shuffle() and permutation().Shuffling ArraysShuffle means changing arrangement of elements in-place. i.e. in the array itself.ExampleGet your own Python ServerRandomly shuffle elements of following array:from numpy import randomimport numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])random.shuffle(arr)print(arr)The shuffle() method makes changes to the original array.Generating Permutation of ArraysExampleGenerate a random permutation of elements of following array:from numpy import randomimport numpy as nparr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])print(random.permutation(arr))The permutation() method returns a re-arranged array (and leaves the original array un-changed).-----SeabornVisualize Distributions With SeabornSeaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions.Install Seaborn.If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, install it using this command:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pip install seabornIf you use Jupyter, install Seaborn using this command:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>!pip install seabornDistplotsDistplot stands for distribution plot, it takes as input an array and plots a curve corresponding to the distribution of points in the array.Import MatplotlibImport the pyplot object of the Matplotlib module in your code using the following statement:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltYou can learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial.Import SeabornImport the Seaborn module in your code using the following statement:import seaborn as snsPlotting a DistplotExampleGet your own Python Serverimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])plt.show()Plotting a Distplot Without the HistogramExampleimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], hist=False)plt.show()Note: We will be using: sns.distplot(arr, hist=False) to visualize random distributions in this tutorial.-----Normal (Gaussian) DistributionNormal DistributionThe Normal Distribution is one of the most important distributions.It is also called the Gaussian Distribution after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.It fits the probability distribution of many events, eg. IQ Scores, Heartbeat etc.Use the random.normal() method to get a Normal Data Distribution.It has three parameters:loc - (Mean) where the peak of the bell exists.scale - (Standard Deviation) how flat the graph distribution should be.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGenerate a random normal distribution of size 2x3:from numpy import randomx = random.normal(size=(2, 3))print(x)ExampleGenerate a random normal distribution of size 2x3 with mean at 1 and standard deviation of 2:from numpy import randomx = random.normal(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Normal DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.normal(size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()ResultNote: The curve of a Normal Distribution is also known as the Bell Curve becauseof the bell-shaped curve.-----Binomial DistributionBinomial DistributionBinomial Distribution is a Discrete Distribution.It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin, it will either be head or tails.It has three parameters:n - number of trials.p - probability of occurence of each trial (e.g. for toss of a coin 0.5 each).size - The shape of the returned array.Discrete Distribution:The distribution is defined at separate set of events, e.g. a coin toss\\'s result is discrete as it can be only head or tails whereas height of people is continuous as it can be 170, 170.1, 170.11 and so on.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGiven 10 trials for coin toss generate 10 data points:from numpy import randomx = random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=10)print(x)Visualization of Binomial DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=1000), hist=True, kde=False)plt.show()ResultDifference Between Normal and Binomial DistributionThe main difference is that normal distribution is continous whereas binomial isdiscrete, but if there are enough data points it will be quite similar to normaldistribution with certain loc and scale.Examplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.normal(loc=50, scale=5, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'normal\\')sns.distplot(random.binomial(n=100, p=0.5, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'binomial\\')plt.show()Result-----Poisson DistributionPoisson DistributionPoisson Distribution is a Discrete Distribution.It estimates how many times an event can happen in a specified time. e.g. If someone eats twice a day what is the probability he will eat thrice?It has two parameters:lam - rate or known number of occurrences e.g. 2 for above problem.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGenerate a random 1x10 distribution for occurrence 2:from numpy import randomx = random.poisson(lam=2, size=10)print(x)Visualization of Poisson DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.poisson(lam=2, size=1000), kde=False)plt.show()ResultADVERTISEMENTDifference Between Normal and Poisson DistributionNormal distribution is continuous whereas poisson is discrete.But we can see that similar to binomial for a large enough poisson distribution it will become similar to normal distribution with certain std dev and mean.Examplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.normal(loc=50, scale=7, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'normal\\')sns.distplot(random.poisson(lam=50, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'poisson\\')plt.show()ResultDifference Between Binomial and Poisson DistributionBinomial distribution only has two possible outcomes, whereas poisson distribution can have unlimited possible outcomes.But for very large n and near-zero p binomial distribution is near identical to poisson distribution such that n * p is nearly equal to lam.Examplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.binomial(n=1000, p=0.01, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'binomial\\')sns.distplot(random.poisson(lam=10, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'poisson\\')plt.show()Result-----Uniform DistributionUniform DistributionUsed to describe probability where every event has equal chances of occuring.E.g. Generation of random numbers.It has three parameters:a - lower bound - default 0 .0.b - upper bound - default 1.0.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a 2x3 uniform distribution sample:from numpy import randomx = random.uniform(size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Uniform DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.uniform(size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()Result-----Logistic DistributionLogistic DistributionLogistic Distribution is used to describe growth.Used extensively in machine learning in logistic regression, neural networks etc.It has three parameters:loc - mean, where the peak is. Default 0.scale - standard deviation, the flatness of distribution. Default 1.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw 2x3 samples from a logistic distribution with mean at 1 and stddev 2.0:from numpy import randomx = random.logistic(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Logistic DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.logistic(size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()ResultDifference Between Logistic and Normal DistributionBoth distributions are near identical, but logistic distribution has more area under the tails, meaning it represents more possibility of occurrence of an event further away from mean.For higher value of scale (standard deviation) the normal and logistic distributions are near identical apart from the peak.Examplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.normal(scale=2, size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'normal\\')sns.distplot(random.logistic(size=1000), hist=False, label=\\'logistic\\')plt.show()Result-----Multinomial DistributionMultinomial DistributionMultinomial distribution is a generalization of binomial distribution.It describes outcomes of multi-nomial scenarios unlike binomial where scenarios must be only one of two. e.g. Blood type of a population, dice roll outcome.It has three parameters:n - number of possible outcomes (e.g. 6 for dice roll).pvals - list of probabilties of outcomes (e.g. [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6] for dice roll).size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw out a sample for dice roll:from numpy import randomx = random.multinomial(n=6, pvals=[1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6])print(x)Note: Multinomial samples will NOT produce a single value! They will produce onevalue for each pval.Note: As they are generalization of binomial distribution their visual representation and similarity of normal distribution is same as that of multiplebinomial distributions.-----Exponential DistributionExponential DistributionExponential distribution is used for describing time till next event e.g. failure/success etc.It has two parameters:scale - inverse of rate ( see lam in poisson distribution ) defaults to 1.0.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw out a sample for exponential distribution with 2.0 scale with 2x3 size:from numpy import randomx = random.exponential(scale=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Exponential DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.exponential(size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()ResultRelation Between Poisson and Exponential DistributionPoisson distribution deals with number of occurences of an event in a time period whereas exponential distribution deals with the time between these events.-----Chi Square DistributionChi Square DistributionChi Square distribution is used as a basis to verify the hypothesis.It has two parameters:df - (degree of freedom).size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw out a sample for chi squared distribution with degree of freedom 2 with size 2x3:from numpy import randomx = random.chisquare(df=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Chi Square DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.chisquare(df=1, size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()Result-----Rayleigh DistributionRayleigh DistributionRayleigh distribution is used in signal processing.It has two parameters:scale - (standard deviation) decides how flat the distribution will be default 1.0).size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw out a sample for rayleigh distribution with scale of 2 with size 2x3:from numpy import randomx = random.rayleigh(scale=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Rayleigh DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.rayleigh(size=1000), hist=False)plt.show()ResultSimilarity Between Rayleigh and Chi Square DistributionAt unit stddev and 2 degrees of freedom rayleigh and chi square represent the same distributions.-----Pareto DistributionPareto DistributionA distribution following Pareto\\'s law i.e. 80-20 distribution (20% factors cause80% outcome).It has two parameter:a - shape parameter.size - The shape of the returned array.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw out a sample for pareto distribution with shape of 2 with size 2x3:from numpy import randomx = random.pareto(a=2, size=(2, 3))print(x)Visualization of Pareto DistributionExamplefrom numpy import randomimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.distplot(random.pareto(a=2, size=1000), kde=False)plt.show()Result-----Zipf DistributionZipf distributions are used to sample data based on zipf\\'s law.Zipf\\'s Law: In a collection, the nth common term is 1/n times of the most commonterm.

Like:Is there a correlation between two or more columns?What is average value?Max value?Min value?Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.Where is the Pandas Codebase?The source code for Pandas is located at this github repository https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas:github: enables many people to work on the same codebase.-----Pandas Getting StartedInstallation of PandasIf you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Pandas is very easy.Install it using this command:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pip install pandasIf this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Pandas installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.Import PandasOnce Pandas is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:import pandasNow Pandas is imported and ready to use.ExampleGet your own Python Serverimport pandasmydataset =   \\'cars\\': [\"BMW\", \"Volvo\", \"Ford\"],   \\'passings\\': [3, 7, 2]myvar = pandas.DataFrame(mydataset)print(myvar)w3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!Pandas as pdPandas is usually imported under the pd alias.alias: In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing.Create an alias with the as keyword while importing:import pandas as pdNow the Pandas package can be referred to as pd instead of pandas.Exampleimport pandas as pd mydataset =   \\'cars\\': [\"BMW\", \"Volvo\", \"Ford\"],   \\'passings\\': [3, 7, 2]myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)print(myvar)Checking Pandas VersionThe version string is stored under __version__ attribute.Exampleimport pandas as pdprint(pd.__version__)-----Pandas SeriesWhat is a Series?A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a simple Pandas Series from a list:import pandas as pd a = [1, 7, 2]myvar = pd.Series(a)print(myvar)LabelsIf nothing else is specified, the values are labeled with their index number. First value has index 0, second value has index 1 etc.This label can be used to access a specified value.ExampleReturn the first value of the Series:print(myvar[0])Create LabelsWith the index argument, you can name your own labels.ExampleCreate your own labels:import pandas as pd a = [1, 7, 2]myvar = pd.Series(a, index = [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])print(myvar)When you have created labels, you can access an item by referring to the label.ExampleReturn the value of \"y\":print(myvar[\"y\"])w3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!Key/Value Objects as SeriesYou can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series.ExampleCreate a simple Pandas Series from a dictionary:import pandas as pd calories = \"day1\": 420, \"day2\": 380, \"day3\": 390myvar = pd.Series(calories)print(myvar)Note: The keys of the dictionary become the labels.To select only some of the items in the dictionary, use the index argument and specify only the items you want to include in the Series.ExampleCreate a Series using only data from \"day1\" and \"day2\":import pandas as pd calories = \"day1\": 420, \"day2\": 380, \"day3\": 390myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = [\"day1\", \"day2\"])print(myvar)DataFramesData sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.ExampleCreate a DataFrame from two Series:import pandas as pd data =   \"calories\": [420, 380, 390],  \"duration\": [50, 40, 45]myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)print(myvar)You will learn about DataFrames in the next chapter.-----Pandas DataFramesWhat is a DataFrame?A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a simple Pandas DataFrame:import pandas as pd data =   \"calories\": [420, 380, 390],  \"duration\": [50, 40, 45]#load data into a DataFrame object:df = pd.DataFrame(data)print(df) Result     calories  duration  0       420        50  1       380        40  2       390        45Locate RowAs you can see from the result above, the DataFrame is like a table with rows and columns.Pandas use the loc attribute to return one or more specified row(s)ExampleReturn row 0:#refer to the row index:print(df.loc[0])Result  calories    420  duration     50  Name: 0, dtype: int64Note: This example returns a Pandas Series.ExampleReturn row 0 and 1:#use a list of indexes:print(df.loc[[0, 1]])Result     calories  duration  0       420        50  1       380        40Note: When using [], the result is a Pandas DataFrame.w3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!Named IndexesWith the index argument, you can name your own indexes.ExampleAdd a list of names to give each row a name:import pandas as pd data =   \"calories\": [420, 380, 390],  \"duration\": [50, 40, 45]df = pd.DataFrame(data, index = [\"day1\", \"day2\", \"day3\"])print(df) Result        calories  duration  day1       420        50  day2       380        40  day3       390        45Locate Named IndexesUse the named index in the loc attribute to return the specified row(s).ExampleReturn \"day2\":#refer to the named index:print(df.loc[\"day2\"])Result  calories    380  duration     40  Name: day2, dtype: int64Load Files Into a DataFrameIf your data sets are stored in a file, Pandas can load them into a DataFrame.ExampleLoad a comma separated file (CSV file) into a DataFrame:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df) You will learn more about importing files in the next chapters.-----Pandas Read CSVRead CSV FilesA simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated files).CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.In our examples we will be using a CSV file called \\'data.csv\\'.Download data.csv. or Open data.csvExampleGet your own Python ServerLoad the CSV into a DataFrame:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df.to_string()) Tip: use to_string() to print the entire DataFrame.If you have a large DataFrame with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows:ExamplePrint the DataFrame without the to_string() method:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df) max_rowsThe number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.You can check your system\\'s maximum rows with the pd.options.display.max_rows statement.ExampleCheck the number of maximum returned rows:import pandas as pdprint(pd.options.display.max_rows) In my system the number is 60, which means that if the DataFrame contains more than 60 rows, the print(df) statement will return only the headers and the firstand last 5 rows.You can change the maximum rows number with the same statement.ExampleIncrease the maximum number of rows to display the entire DataFrame:import pandas as pdpd.options.display.max_rows = 9999df = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df) -----Pandas Read JSONRead JSONBig data sets are often stored, or extracted as JSON.JSON is plain text, but has the format of an object, and is well known in the world of programming, including Pandas.In our examples we will be using a JSON file called \\'data.json\\'.Open data.json.ExampleGet your own Python ServerLoad the JSON file into a DataFrame:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_json(\\'data.json\\')print(df.to_string()) Tip: use to_string() to print the entire DataFrame.Dictionary as JSONJSON = Python DictionaryJSON objects have the same format as Python dictionaries.If your JSON code is not in a file, but in a Python Dictionary, you can load it into a DataFrame directly:ExampleLoad a Python Dictionary into a DataFrame:import pandas as pddata =   \"Duration\":    \"0\":60,    \"1\":60,    \"2\":60,    \"3\":45,    \"4\":45,    \"5\":60  ,  \"Pulse\":    \"0\":110,    \"1\":117,    \"2\":103,    \"3\":109,    \"4\":117,    \"5\":102  ,  \"Maxpulse\":    \"0\":130,    \"1\":145,    \"2\":135,    \"3\":175,    \"4\":148,    \"5\":127  ,  \"Calories\":    \"0\":409,    \"1\":479,    \"2\":340,    \"3\":282,    \"4\":406,    \"5\":300  df = pd.DataFrame(data)print(df) -----Pandas - Analyzing DataFramesViewing the DataOne of the most used method for getting a quick overview of the DataFrame, is the head() method.The head() method returns the headers and a specified number of rows, starting from the top.ExampleGet your own Python ServerGet a quick overview by printing the first 10 rows of the DataFrame:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df.head(10))In our examples we will be using a CSV file called \\'data.csv\\'.Download data.csv, or open data.csv in your browser.Note: if the number of rows is not specified, the head() method will return the top 5 rows.ExamplePrint the first 5 rows of the DataFrame:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')print(df.head())There is also a tail() method for viewing the last rows of the DataFrame.The tail() method returns the headers and a specified number of rows, starting from the bottom.ExamplePrint the last 5 rows of the DataFrame:print(df.tail()) w3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!Info About the DataThe DataFrames object has a method called info(), that gives you more information about the data set.ExamplePrint information about the data:print(df.info()) Result    RangeIndex: 169 entries, 0 to 168  Data columns (total 4 columns):   #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype    ---  ------    --------------  -----     0   Duration  169 non-null    int64     1   Pulse     169 non-null    int64     2   Maxpulse  169 non-null    int64     3   Calories  164 non-null    float64  dtypes: float64(1), int64(3)  memory usage: 5.4 KB  None    Result ExplainedThe result tells us there are 169 rows and 4 columns:  RangeIndex: 169 entries, 0 to 168  Data columns (total 4 columns):And the name of each column, with the data type:   #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype    ---  ------    --------------  -----     0   Duration  169 non-null    int64     1   Pulse     169 non-null    int64     2   Maxpulse  169 non-null    int64     3   Calories  164 non-null    float64Null ValuesThe info() method also tells us how many Non-Null values there are present in each column, and in our data set it seems like there are 164 of 169 Non-Null values in the \"Calories\" column.Which means that there are 5 rows with no value at all, in the \"Calories\" column, for whatever reason.Empty values, or Null values, can be bad when analyzing data, and you should consider removing rows with empty values. This is a step towards what is called cleaning data, and you will learn more about that in the next chapters.-----Pandas - Cleaning DataData CleaningData cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.Bad data could be:Empty cellsData in wrong formatWrong dataDuplicatesIn this tutorial you will learn how to deal with all of them.Our Data SetIn the next chapters we will use this data set:      Duration          Date  Pulse  Maxpulse  Calories  0         60  \\'2020/12/01\\'    110       130     409.1  1         60  \\'2020/12/02\\'    117       145     479.0  2         60  \\'2020/12/03\\'    103       135     340.0  3         45  \\'2020/12/04\\'    109       175     282.4  4         45  \\'2020/12/05\\'    117       148     406.0  5         60  \\'2020/12/06\\'    102       127     300.0  6         60  \\'2020/12/07\\'    110       136     374.0  7        450  \\'2020/12/08\\'    104       134     253.3  8         30  \\'2020/12/09\\'    109       133     195.1  9         60  \\'2020/12/10\\'     98       124     269.0  10        60  \\'2020/12/11\\'    103       147     329.3  11        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  12        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  13        60  \\'2020/12/13\\'    106       128     345.3  14        60  \\'2020/12/14\\'    104       132     379.3  15        60  \\'2020/12/15\\'     98       123     275.0  16        60  \\'2020/12/16\\'     98       120     215.2  17        60  \\'2020/12/17\\'    100       120     300.0  18        45  \\'2020/12/18\\'     90       112       NaN  19        60  \\'2020/12/19\\'    103       123     323.0  20        45  \\'2020/12/20\\'     97       125     243.0  21        60  \\'2020/12/21\\'    108       131     364.2  22        45           NaN    100       119     282.0  23        60  \\'2020/12/23\\'    130       101     300.0  24        45  \\'2020/12/24\\'    105       132     246.0  25        60  \\'2020/12/25\\'    102       126     334.5  26        60    2020/12/26    100       120     250.0  27        60  \\'2020/12/27\\'     92       118     241.0  28        60  \\'2020/12/28\\'    103       132       NaN  29        60  \\'2020/12/29\\'    100       132     280.0  30        60  \\'2020/12/30\\'    102       129     380.3  31        60  \\'2020/12/31\\'     92       115     243.0The data set contains some empty cells (\"Date\" in row 22, and \"Calories\" in row 18 and 28).The data set contains wrong format (\"Date\" in row 26).The data set contains wrong data (\"Duration\" in row 7).The data set contains duplicates (row 11 and 12).-----Pandas - Cleaning Empty CellsEmpty CellsEmpty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.Remove RowsOne way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells.This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result.ExampleGet your own Python ServerReturn a new Data Frame with no empty cells:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')new_df = df.dropna()print(new_df.to_string())Note: By default, the dropna() method returns a new DataFrame, and will not change the original.If you want to change the original DataFrame, use the inplace = True argument:ExampleRemove all rows with NULL values:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df.dropna(inplace = True)print(df.to_string())Note: Now, the dropna(inplace = True) will NOT return a new DataFrame, but it will remove all rows containing NULL values from the original DataFrame.Replace Empty ValuesAnother way of dealing with empty cells is to insert a new value instead.This way you do not have to delete entire rows just because of some empty cells.The fillna() method allows us to replace empty cells with a value:ExampleReplace NULL values with the number 130:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df.fillna(130, inplace = True)Replace Only For Specified ColumnsThe example above replaces all empty cells in the whole Data Frame.To only replace empty values for one column, specify the column name for the DataFrame:ExampleReplace NULL values in the \"Calories\" columns with the number 130:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df[\"Calories\"].fillna(130, inplace = True)w3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!Replace Using Mean, Median, or ModeA common way to replace empty cells, is to calculate the mean, median or mode value of the column.Pandas uses the mean() median() and mode() methods to calculate the respective values for a specified column:ExampleCalculate the MEAN, and replace any empty values with it:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')x = df[\"Calories\"].mean()df[\"Calories\"].fillna(x, inplace = True)Mean = the average value (the sum of all values divided by number of values).ExampleCalculate the MEDIAN, and replace any empty values with it:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')x = df[\"Calories\"].median()df[\"Calories\"].fillna(x, inplace = True)Median = the value in the middle, after you have sorted all values ascending.ExampleCalculate the MODE, and replace any empty values with it:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')x = df[\"Calories\"].mode()[0]df[\"Calories\"].fillna(x, inplace = True)Mode = the value that appears most frequently.-----Pandas - Cleaning Data of Wrong FormatData of Wrong FormatCells with data of wrong format can make it difficult, or even impossible, to analyze data.To fix it, you have two options: remove the rows, or convert all cells in the columns into the same format.Convert Into a Correct FormatIn our Data Frame, we have two cells with the wrong format. Check out row 22 and26, the \\'Date\\' column should be a string that represents a date:      Duration          Date  Pulse  Maxpulse  Calories  0         60  \\'2020/12/01\\'    110       130     409.1  1         60  \\'2020/12/02\\'    117       145     479.0  2         60  \\'2020/12/03\\'    103       135     340.0  3         45  \\'2020/12/04\\'    109       175     282.4  4         45  \\'2020/12/05\\'    117       148     406.0  5         60  \\'2020/12/06\\'    102       127     300.0  6         60  \\'2020/12/07\\'    110       136     374.0  7        450  \\'2020/12/08\\'    104       134     253.3  8         30  \\'2020/12/09\\'    109       133     195.1  9         60  \\'2020/12/10\\'     98       124     269.0  10        60  \\'2020/12/11\\'    103       147     329.3  11        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  12        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  13        60  \\'2020/12/13\\'    106       128     345.3  14        60  \\'2020/12/14\\'    104       132     379.3  15        60  \\'2020/12/15\\'     98       123     275.0  16        60  \\'2020/12/16\\'     98       120     215.2  17        60  \\'2020/12/17\\'    100       120     300.0  18        45  \\'2020/12/18\\'     90       112       NaN  19        60  \\'2020/12/19\\'    103       123     323.0  20        45  \\'2020/12/20\\'     97       125     243.0  21        60  \\'2020/12/21\\'    108       131     364.2  22        45           NaN    100       119     282.0  23        60  \\'2020/12/23\\'    130       101     300.0  24        45  \\'2020/12/24\\'    105       132     246.0  25        60  \\'2020/12/25\\'    102       126     334.5  26        60      20201226    100       120     250.0  27        60  \\'2020/12/27\\'     92       118     241.0  28        60  \\'2020/12/28\\'    103       132       NaN  29        60  \\'2020/12/29\\'    100       132     280.0  30        60  \\'2020/12/30\\'    102       129     380.3  31        60  \\'2020/12/31\\'     92       115     243.0Let\\'s try to convert all cells in the \\'Date\\' column into dates.Pandas has a to_datetime() method for this:ExampleGet your own Python ServerConvert to date:import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df[\\'Date\\'] = pd.to_datetime(df[\\'Date\\'])print(df.to_string())Result:      Duration          Date  Pulse  Maxpulse  Calories  0         60  \\'2020/12/01\\'    110       130     409.1  1         60  \\'2020/12/02\\'    117       145     479.0  2         60  \\'2020/12/03\\'    103       135     340.0  3         45  \\'2020/12/04\\'    109       175     282.4  4         45  \\'2020/12/05\\'    117       148     406.0  5         60  \\'2020/12/06\\'    102       127     300.0  6         60  \\'2020/12/07\\'    110       136     374.0  7        450  \\'2020/12/08\\'    104       134     253.3  8         30  \\'2020/12/09\\'    109       133     195.1  9         60  \\'2020/12/10\\'     98       124     269.0  10        60  \\'2020/12/11\\'    103       147     329.3  11        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  12        60  \\'2020/12/12\\'    100       120     250.7  13        60  \\'2020/12/13\\'    106       128     345.3  14        60  \\'2020/12/14\\'    104       132     379.3  15        60  \\'2020/12/15\\'     98       123     275.0  16        60  \\'2020/12/16\\'     98       120     215.2  17        60  \\'2020/12/17\\'    100       120     300.0  18        45  \\'2020/12/18\\'     90       112       NaN  19        60  \\'2020/12/19\\'    103       123     323.0  20        45  \\'2020/12/20\\'     97       125     243.0  21        60  \\'2020/12/21\\'    108       131     364.2  22        45           NaT    100       119     282.0  23        60  \\'2020/12/23\\'    130       101     300.0  24        45  \\'2020/12/24\\'    105       132     246.0  25        60  \\'2020/12/25\\'    102       126     334.5  26        60  \\'2020/12/26\\'    100       120     250.0  27        60  \\'2020/12/27\\'     92       118     241.0  28        60  \\'2020/12/28\\'    103       132       NaN  29        60  \\'2020/12/29\\'    100       132     280.0  30        60  \\'2020/12/30\\'    102       129     380.3  31        60  \\'2020/12/31\\'     92       115     243.0As you can see from the result, the date in row 26 was fixed, but the empty datein row 22 got a NaT (Not a Time) value, in other words an empty value.

It depends on the use, but I think it is safe to sayyou have to have at least 0.6 (or -0.6) to call it a good correlation.Perfect Correlation:We can see that \"Duration\" and \"Duration\" got the number 1.000000, which makes sense, each column always has a perfect relationship with itself.Good Correlation:\"Duration\" and \"Calories\" got a 0.922721 correlation, which is a very good correlation, and we can predict that the longer you work out, the more calories you burn, and the other way around: if you burned a lot of calories, you probably had a long work out.Bad Correlation:\"Duration\" and \"Maxpulse\" got a 0.009403 correlation, which is a very bad correlation, meaning that we can not predict the max pulse by just looking at the duration of the work out, and vice versa.-----Pandas - PlottingPlottingPandas uses the plot() method to create diagrams.We can use Pyplot, a submodule of the Matplotlib library to visualize the diagram on the screen.Read more about Matplotlib in our Matplotlib Tutorial.ExampleGet your own Python ServerImport pyplot from Matplotlib and visualize our DataFrame:import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df.plot()plt.show()The examples in this page uses a CSV file called: \\'data.csv\\'.Download data.csv or Open data.csvScatter PlotSpecify that you want a scatter plot with the kind argument:kind = \\'scatter\\'A scatter plot needs an x- and a y-axis.In the example below we will use \"Duration\" for the x-axis and \"Calories\" for the y-axis.Include the x and y arguments like this:x = \\'Duration\\', y = \\'Calories\\'Exampleimport pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df.plot(kind = \\'scatter\\', x = \\'Duration\\', y = \\'Calories\\')plt.show()ResultRemember: In the previous example, we learned that the correlation between \"Duration\" and \"Calories\" was 0.922721, and we concluded with the fact that higher duration means more calories burned.By looking at the scatterplot, I will agree.Let\\'s create another scatterplot, where there is a bad relationship between the columns, like \"Duration\" and \"Maxpulse\", with the correlation 0.009403:ExampleA scatterplot where there are no relationship between the columns:import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdf = pd.read_csv(\\'data.csv\\')df.plot(kind = \\'scatter\\', x = \\'Duration\\', y = \\'Maxpulse\\')plt.show()Resultw3schoolsCERTIFIED.2022Get Certified!Complete the Pandas modules, do the exercises, take the exam, and you will become w3schools certified!HistogramUse the kind argument to specify that you want a histogram:kind = \\'hist\\'A histogram needs only one column.A histogram shows us the frequency of each interval, e.g. how many workouts lasted between 50 and 60 minutes?In the example below we will use the \"Duration\" column to create the histogram:Exampledf[\"Duration\"].plot(kind = \\'hist\\')ResultNote: The histogram tells us that there were over 100 workouts that lasted between 50 and 60 minutes.-----Pandas - DataFrame ReferenceAll properties and methods of the DataFrame

Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of SciPy is very easy.Install it using this command:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pip install scipyIf this command fails, then use a Python distribution that already has SciPy installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.Import SciPyOnce SciPy is installed, import the SciPy module(s) you want to use in your applications by adding the from scipy import module statement:from scipy import constantsNow we have imported the constants module from SciPy, and the application is ready to use it:ExampleHow many cubic meters are in one liter:from scipy import constants print(constants.liter)constants: SciPy offers a set of mathematical constants, one of them is liter which returns 1 liter as cubic meters.You will learn more about constants in the next chapter.Checking SciPy VersionThe version string is stored under the __version__ attribute.Exampleimport scipyprint(scipy.__version__)Note: two underscore characters are used in __version__.-----SciPy ConstantsConstants in SciPyAs SciPy is more focused on scientific implementations, it provides many built-in scientific constants.These constants can be helpful when you are working with Data Science.PI is an example of a scientific constant.ExamplePrint the constant value of PI:from scipy import constants print(constants.pi)Constant UnitsA list of all units under the constants module can be seen using the dir() function.ExampleList all constants:from scipy import constants print(dir(constants))Unit CategoriesThe units are placed under these

root of an equation.Optimizing FunctionsEssentially, all of the algorithms in Machine Learning are nothing more than a complex equation that needs to be minimized with the help of given data.Roots of an EquationNumPy is capable of finding roots for polynomials and linear equations, but it can not find roots for non linear equations, like this one:x + cos(x)For that you can use SciPy\\'s optimze.root function.This function takes two required arguments:fun - a function representing an equation.x0 - an initial guess for the root.The function returns an object with information regarding the solution.The actual solution is given under attribute x of the returned object:ExampleFind root of the equation x + cos(x):from scipy.optimize import root from math import cos def eqn(x):  return x + cos(x)myroot = root(eqn, 0)print(myroot.x)Note: The returned object has much more information about the solution.ExamplePrint all information about the solution (not just x which is the root)print(myroot)ADVERTISEMENTMinimizing a FunctionA function, in this context, represents a curve, curves have high points and lowpoints.High points are called maxima.Low points are called minima.The highest point in the whole curve is called global maxima, whereas the rest of them are called local maxima.The lowest point in whole curve is called global minima, whereas the rest of them are called local minima.Finding MinimaWe can use scipy.optimize.minimize() function to minimize the function.The minimize() function takes the following arguments:fun - a function representing an equation.x0 - an initial guess for the root.method - name of the method to use. Legal values:    \\'CG\\'    \\'BFGS\\'    \\'Newton-CG\\'    \\'L-BFGS-B\\'    \\'TNC\\'    \\'COBYLA\\'    \\'SLSQP\\'callback - function called after each iteration of optimization.options - a dictionary defining extra params:     \"disp\": boolean - print detailed description      \"gtol\": number - the tolerance of the error  ExampleMinimize the function x^2 + x + 2 with BFGS:from scipy.optimize import minimizedef eqn(x):  return x**2 + x + 2mymin = minimize(eqn, 0, method=\\'BFGS\\')print(mymin)-----SciPy Sparse DataWhat is Sparse DataSparse data is data that has mostly unused elements (elements that don\\'t carry any information ).It can be an array like this one:[1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]Sparse Data: is a data set where most of the item values are zero.Dense Array: is the opposite of a sparse array: most of the values are not zero.In scientific computing, when we are dealing with partial derivatives in linear algebra we will come across sparse data.How to Work With Sparse DataSciPy has a module, scipy.sparse that provides functions to deal with sparse data.There are primarily two types of sparse matrices that we use:CSC - Compressed Sparse Column. For efficient arithmetic, fast column slicing.CSR - Compressed Sparse Row. For fast row slicing, faster matrix vector productsWe will use the CSR matrix in this tutorial.CSR MatrixWe can create CSR matrix by passing an arrray into function scipy.sparse.csr_matrix().ExampleCreate a CSR matrix from an array:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix arr = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]) print(csr_matrix(arr))The example above returns:  (0, 5)1  (0, 6)1  (0, 8)2From the result we can see that there are 3 items with value.The 1. item is in row 0 position 5 and has the value 1.The 2. item is in row 0 position 6 and has the value 1.The 3. item is in row 0 position 8 and has the value 2.ADVERTISEMENTSparse Matrix MethodsViewing stored data (not the zero items) with the data property:Exampleimport numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix arr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2]]) print(csr_matrix(arr).data)Counting nonzeros with the count_nonzero() method:Exampleimport numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix arr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2]]) print(csr_matrix(arr).count_nonzero())Removing zero-entries from the matrix with the eliminate_zeros() method:Exampleimport numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2]])mat = csr_matrix(arr)mat.eliminate_zeros()print(mat)Eliminating duplicate entries with the sum_duplicates() method:ExampleEliminating duplicates by adding them:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2]])mat = csr_matrix(arr)mat.sum_duplicates()print(mat)Converting from csr to csc with the tocsc() method:Exampleimport numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix arr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2]]) newarr = csr_matrix(arr).tocsc() print(newarr)Note: Apart from the mentioned sparse specific operations, sparse matrices support all of the operations that normal matrices support e.g. reshaping, summing, arithemetic, broadcasting etc.-----SciPy GraphsWorking with GraphsGraphs are an essential data structure.SciPy provides us with the module scipy.sparse.csgraph for working with such data structures.Adjacency MatrixAdjacency matrix is a nxn matrix where n is the number of elements in a graph.And the values represents the connection between the elements.Example:For a graph like this, with elements A, B and C, the connections are:A & B are connected with weight 1.A & C are connected with weight 2.C & B is not connected.The Adjency Matrix would look like this:      A B C   A:[0 1 2]     B:[1 0 0]   C:[2 0 0]Below follows some of the most used methods for working with adjacency matrices.Connected ComponentsFind all of the connected components with the connected_components() method.Exampleimport numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import connected_componentsfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, 1, 2],  [1, 0, 0],  [2, 0, 0]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(connected_components(newarr))ADVERTISEMENTDijkstraUse the dijkstra method to find the shortest path in a graph from one element toanother.It takes following arguments:return_predecessors: boolean (True to return whole path of traversal otherwise False).indices: index of the element to return all paths from that element only.limit: max weight of path.ExampleFind the shortest path from element 1 to 2:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import dijkstrafrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, 1, 2],  [1, 0, 0],  [2, 0, 0]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(dijkstra(newarr, return_predecessors=True, indices=0))Floyd WarshallUse the floyd_warshall() method to find shortest path between all pairs of elements.ExampleFind the shortest path between all pairs of elements:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import floyd_warshallfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, 1, 2],  [1, 0, 0],  [2, 0, 0]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(floyd_warshall(newarr, return_predecessors=True))Bellman FordThe bellman_ford() method can also find the shortest path between all pairs of elements, but this method can handle negative weights as well.ExampleFind shortest path from element 1 to 2 with given graph with a negative weight:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import bellman_fordfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, -1, 2],  [1, 0, 0],  [2, 0, 0]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(bellman_ford(newarr, return_predecessors=True, indices=0))Depth First OrderThe depth_first_order() method returns a depth first traversal from a node.This function takes following arguments:the graph.the starting element to traverse graph from.ExampleTraverse the graph depth first for given adjacency matrix:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import depth_first_orderfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, 1, 0, 1],  [1, 1, 1, 1],  [2, 1, 1, 0],  [0, 1, 0, 1]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(depth_first_order(newarr, 1))Breadth First OrderThe breadth_first_order() method returns a breadth first traversal from a node.This function takes following arguments:the graph.the starting element to traverse graph from.ExampleTraverse the graph breadth first for given adjacency matrix:import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import breadth_first_orderfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrixarr = np.array([  [0, 1, 0, 1],  [1, 1, 1, 1],  [2, 1, 1, 0],  [0, 1, 0, 1]])newarr = csr_matrix(arr)print(breadth_first_order(newarr, 1))-----SciPy Spatial DataWorking with Spatial DataSpatial data refers to data that is represented in a geometric space.E.g. points on a coordinate system.We deal with spatial data problems on many tasks.E.g. finding if a point is inside a boundary or not.SciPy provides us with the module scipy.spatial, which has functions for workingwith spatial data.TriangulationA Triangulation of a polygon is to divide the polygon into multiple triangles with which we can compute an area of the polygon.A Triangulation with points means creating surface composed triangles in which all of the given points are on at least one vertex of any triangle in the surface.One method to generate these triangulations through points is the Delaunay() Triangulation.ExampleCreate a triangulation from following points:import numpy as npfrom scipy.spatial import Delaunayimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltpoints = np.array([  [2, 4],  [3, 4],  [3, 0],  [2, 2],  [4, 1]])simplices = Delaunay(points).simplicesplt.triplot(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], simplices)plt.scatter(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], color=\\'r\\')plt.show()Result:Note: The simplices property creates a generalization of the triangle notation.ADVERTISEMENTConvex HullA convex hull is the smallest polygon that covers all of the given points.Use the ConvexHull() method to create a Convex Hull.ExampleCreate a convex hull for following points:import numpy as npfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHullimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltpoints = np.array([  [2, 4],  [3, 4],  [3, 0],  [2, 2],  [4, 1],  [1, 2],  [5, 0],  [3, 1],  [1, 2],  [0, 2]])hull = ConvexHull(points)hull_points = hull.simplicesplt.scatter(points[:,0], points[:,1])for simplex in hull_points:  plt.plot(points[simplex,0], points[simplex,1], \\'k-\\')plt.show()Result:KDTreesKDTrees are a datastructure optimized for nearest neighbor queries.E.g. in a set of points using KDTrees we can efficiently ask which points are nearest to a certain given point.The KDTree() method returns a KDTree object.The query() method returns the distance to the nearest neighbor and the locationof the neighbors.ExampleFind the nearest neighbor to point (1,1):from scipy.spatial import KDTreepoints = [(1, -1), (2, 3), (-2, 3), (2, -3)]kdtree = KDTree(points)res = kdtree.query((1, 1))print(res)Result: (2.0, 0)Distance MatrixThere are many Distance Metrics used to find various types of distances between two points in data science, Euclidean distsance, cosine distsance etc.The distance between two vectors may not only be the length of straight line between them, it can also be the angle between them from origin, or number of unit steps required etc.Many of the Machine Learning algorithm\\'s performance depends greatly on distancemetrices. E.g. \"K Nearest Neighbors\", or \"K Means\" etc.Let us look at some of the Distance Metrices:Euclidean DistanceFind the euclidean distance between given points.Examplefrom scipy.spatial.distance import euclideanp1 = (1, 0)p2 = (10, 2)res = euclidean(p1, p2)print(res)Result: 9.21954445729Cityblock Distance (Manhattan Distance)Is the distance computed using 4 degrees of movement.E.g. we can only move: up, down, right, or left, not diagonally.ExampleFind the cityblock distance between given points:from scipy.spatial.distance import cityblockp1 = (1, 0)p2 = (10, 2)res = cityblock(p1, p2)print(res)Result: 11Cosine DistanceIs the value of cosine angle between the two points A and B.ExampleFind the cosine distsance between given points:from scipy.spatial.distance import cosinep1 = (1, 0)p2 = (10, 2)res = cosine(p1, p2)print(res)Result: 0.019419324309079777Hamming DistanceIs the proportion of bits where two bits are different.It\\'s a way to measure distance for binary sequences.ExampleFind the hamming distance between given points:from scipy.spatial.distance import hammingp1 = (True, False, True)p2 = (False, True, True)res = hamming(p1, p2)print(res)Result: 0.666666666667-----SciPy Matlab ArraysWorking With Matlab ArraysWe know that NumPy provides us with methods to persist the data in readable formats for Python. But SciPy provides us with interoperability with Matlab as well.SciPy provides us with the module scipy.io, which has functions for working withMatlab arrays.Exporting Data in Matlab FormatThe savemat() function allows us to export data in Matlab format.The method takes the following parameters:filename - the file name for saving data.mdict - a dictionary containing the data.do_compression - a boolean value that specifies whether to compress the result or not. Default False.ExampleExport the following array as variable name \"vec\" to a mat file:from scipy import ioimport numpy as nparr = np.arange(10)io.savemat(\\'arr.mat\\', \"vec\": arr)Note: The example above saves a file name \"arr.mat\" on your computer.To open the file, check out the \"Import Data from Matlab Format\" example below:ADVERTISEMENTImport Data from Matlab FormatThe loadmat() function allows us to import data from a Matlab file.The function takes one required parameter:filename - the file name of the saved data.It will return a structured array whose keys are the variable names, and the corresponding values are the variable values.ExampleImport the array from following mat file.:from scipy import ioimport numpy as nparr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,])# Export: io.savemat(\\'arr.mat\\', \"vec\": arr)# Import:mydata = io.loadmat(\\'arr.mat\\')print(mydata)Result:    \\'__header__\\': b\\'MATLAB 5.0 MAT-file Platform: nt, Created on: Tue Sep 22 13:12:32 2020\\',   \\'__version__\\': \\'1.0\\',   \\'__globals__\\': [],   \\'vec\\': array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]) Use the variable name \"vec\" to display only the array from the matlab data:Example...print(mydata[\\'vec\\'])Result: [[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]]Note: We can see that the array originally was 1D, but on extraction it has increased one dimension.In order to resolve this we can pass an additional argument squeeze_me=True:Example# Import:mydata = io.loadmat(\\'arr.mat\\', squeeze_me=True)print(mydata[\\'vec\\'])Result: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]-----SciPy InterpolationWhat is Interpolation?Interpolation is a method for generating points between given points.For example: for points 1 and 2, we may interpolate and find points 1.33 and 1.66.Interpolation has many usage, in Machine Learning we often deal with missing data in a dataset, interpolation is often used to substitute those values.This method of filling values is called imputation.Apart from imputation, interpolation is often used where we need to smooth the discrete points in a dataset.How to Implement it in SciPy?SciPy provides us with a module called scipy.interpolate which has many functions to deal with interpolation:1D InterpolationThe function interp1d() is used to interpolate a distribution with 1 variable.It takes x and y points and returns a callable function that can be called with new x and returns corresponding y.ExampleFor given xs and ys interpolate values from 2.1, 2.2... to 2.9:from scipy.interpolate import interp1dimport numpy as npxs = np.arange(10)ys = 2*xs + 1interp_func = interp1d(xs, ys)newarr = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1))print(newarr)Result:  [5.2  5.4  5.6  5.8  6.   6.2  6.4  6.6  6.8]Note: that new xs should be in same range as of the old xs, meaning that we can\\'t call interp_func() with values higher than 10, or less than 0.ADVERTISEMENTSpline InterpolationIn 1D interpolation the points are fitted for a single curve whereas in Spline interpolation the points are fitted against a piecewise function defined with polynomials called splines.The UnivariateSpline() function takes xs and ys and produce a callable funciton that can be called with new xs.Piecewise function: A function that has different definition for different ranges.ExampleFind univariate spline interpolation for 2.1, 2.2... 2.9 for the following non linear points:from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSplineimport numpy as npxs = np.arange(10)ys = xs**2 + np.sin(xs) + 1interp_func = UnivariateSpline(xs, ys)newarr = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1)) print(newarr)Result:  [5.62826474 6.03987348 6.47131994 6.92265019 7.3939103  7.88514634   8.39640439 8.92773053 9.47917082]Interpolation with Radial Basis FunctionRadial basis function is a function that is defined corresponding to a fixed reference point.The Rbf() function also takes xs and ys as arguments and produces a callable function that can be called with new xs.ExampleInterpolate following xs and ys using rbf and find values for 2.1, 2.2 ... 2.9:from scipy.interpolate import Rbfimport numpy as npxs = np.arange(10)ys = xs**2 + np.sin(xs) + 1interp_func = Rbf(xs, ys)newarr = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1))print(newarr)Result:  [6.25748981  6.62190817  7.00310702  7.40121814  7.8161443   8.24773402   8.69590519  9.16070828  9.64233874]-----SciPy Statistical Significance TestsWhat is Statistical Significance Test?In statistics, statistical significance means that the result that was produced has a reason behind it, it was not produced randomly, or by chance.SciPy provides us with a module called scipy.stats, which has functions for performing statistical significance tests.Here are some techniques and keywords that are important when performing such tests:Hypothesis in StatisticsHypothesis is an assumption about a parameter in population.Null HypothesisIt assumes that the observation is not statistically significant.Alternate HypothesisIt assumes that the observations are due to some reason.It\\'s alternate to Null Hypothesis.Example:For an assessment of a student we would take:\"student is worse than average\" - as a null hypothesis, and:\"student is better than average\" - as an alternate hypothesis.One tailed testWhen our hypothesis is testing for one side of the value only, it is called \"onetailed test\".Example:For the null hypothesis:\"the mean is equal to k\", we can have alternate hypothesis:\"the mean is less than k\", or:\"the mean is greater than k\"Two tailed testWhen our hypothesis is testing for both side of the values.Example:For the null hypothesis:\"the mean is equal to k\", we can have alternate hypothesis:\"the mean is not equal to k\"In this case the mean is less than, or greater than k, and both sides are to be checked.Alpha valueAlpha value is the level of significance.Example:How close to extremes the data must be for null hypothesis to be rejected.It is usually taken as 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1.P valueP value tells how close to extreme the data actually is.P value and alpha values are compared to establish the statistical significance.If p value Hello  firstname , how are you?Start the ExerciseDjango QuizLearn by taking a quiz!

Learning by ReferencesYou will also find references over the most common Django features:Template Tags QuerySet Filters Field Lookups-----Django IntroductionWhat is Django?Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on buildingyour web applications.Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don\\'t Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).Django is especially helpful for database driven websites.How does Django Work?Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.ModelThe model provides data from the database.In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which isa technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQLis that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.The models are usually located in a file called models.py.ViewA view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.The views are usually located in a file called views.py.TemplateA template is a file where you describe how the result should be represented.Templates are often .html files, with HTML code describing the layout of a web page, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results, but we will concentrate on .html files.Django uses standard HTML to describe the layout, but uses Django tags to add logic:My HomepageMy name is  firstname .The templates of an application is located in a folder named templates.URLsDjango also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.This is done in a file called urls.py.So, What is Going On?When you have installed Django and created your first Django web application, and the browser requests the URL, this is basically what happens:Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.The models are imported from the models.py file.The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.Django can do a lot more than this, but this is basically what you will learn inthis tutorial, and are the basic steps in a simple web application made with Django.Django HistoryDjango was invented by Lawrence Journal-World in 2003, to meet the short deadlines in the newspaper and at the same time meeting the demands of experienced web developers.Initial release to the public was in July 2005.Latest version of Django is 4.0.3 (March 2022).-----Django Getting StartedTo install Django, you must have Python installed, and a package manager like PIP.PIP is included in Python from version 3.4.Django Requires PythonTo check if your system has Python installed, run this command in the command prompt:python --versionIf Python is installed, you will get a result with the version number, like thisPython 3.9.2If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you candownload it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/PIPTo install Django, you must use a package manager like PIP, which is included inPython from version 3.4.To check if your system has PIP installed, run this command in the command prompt:pip --versionIf PIP is installed, you will get a result with the version number.For me, on a windows machine, the result looks like this:pip 20.2.3 from c:\\\\python39\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\pip (python 3.9)If you do not have PIP installed, you can download and install it from this page: https://pypi.org/project/pip/Virtual EnvironmentIt is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project,and in the next chapter you will learn how to create a virtual environment, and then install Django in it.-----Django - Create Virtual EnvironmentVirtual EnvironmentIt is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project,and one way to manage a virtual environment is venv, which is included in Python.The name of the virtual environment is your choice, in this tutorial we will call it myworld.Type the following in the command prompt, remember to navigate to where you wantto create your project:Windows:py -m venv myworldUnix/MacOS:python -m venv myworldThis will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named \"myworld\" withsubfolders and files, like this:myworld  Include  Lib  Scripts  pyvenv.cfgThen you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:Windows:myworld\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.batUnix/MacOS:source myworld/bin/activateOnce the environment is activated, you will see this result in the command prompt:Windows:(myworld) C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>Unix/MacOS:(myworld) ... $Note: You must activate the virtual environment every time you open the command prompt to work on your project.Install DjangoIn the next chapter you will finally learn how to install Django!-----Install DjangoInstall DjangoNow, that we have created a virtual environment, we are ready to install Django.Note: Remember to install Django while you are in the virtual environment!Django is installed using pip, with this command:Windows:(myworld) C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>py -m pip install DjangoUnix/MacOS:(myworld) ... $ python -m pip install DjangoWhich will give a result that looks like this (at least on my Windows machine):Collecting Django  Downloading Django-4.0.3-py3-none-any.whl (8.0 MB)      |ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ| 8.0 MB 2.2 MB/s \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88Collecting sqlparse>=0.2.2  Using cached sqlparse-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl (42 kB)Collecting asgiref=3.4.1  Downloading asgiref-3.5.0-py3-none-any.whl (22 kB)Collecting tzdata; sys_platform == \"win32\"  Downloading tzdata-2021.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl (339 kB)      |ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ| 339 kB 6.4 MB/s \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88Installing collected packages: sqlparse, asgiref, tzdata, DjangoSuccessfully installed Django-4.0.3 asgiref-3.5.0 sqlparse-0.4.2 tzdata-2021.5WARNING: You are using pip version 20.2.3; however, version 22.3 is available.You should consider upgrading via the \\'C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\Scripts\\\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip\\' command.That\\'s it! Now you have installed Django in your new project, running in a virtual environment!Windows, Mac, or Unix?You can run this project on either one. There are some small differences, like when writing commands in the command prompt, Windows uses py as the first word in the command line, while Unix and MacOS use python:Windows:py --versionUnix/MacOS:python --versionIn the rest of this tutorial, we will be using the Windows command.Check Django VersionYou can check if Django is installed by asking for its version number like this:(myworld) C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>django-admin --versionIf Django is installed, you will get a result with the version number:4.1.2What\\'s Next?Now you are ready to create a Django project in a virtual environment on your computer.In the next chapters of this tutorial we will create a Django project and look at the various features of Django and hopefully make you a Django developer.-----Django Create ProjectMy First ProjectOnce you have come up with a suitable name for your Django project, like mine: my_tennis_club, navigate to where in the file system you want to store the code (in the virtual environment), I will navigate to the myworld folder, and run this command in the command prompt:django-admin startproject my_tennis_clubDjango creates a my_tennis_club folder on my computer, with this content:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/        __init__.py        asgi.py        settings.py        urls.py        wsgi.pyThese are all files and folders with a specific meaning, you will learn about some of them later in this tutorial, but for now, it is more important to know that this is the location of your project, and that you can start building applications in it.Run the Django ProjectNow that you have a Django project, you can run it, and see what it looks like in a browser.Navigate to the /my_tennis_club folder and execute this command in the command prompt:py manage.py runserverWhich will produce this result:Watching for file changes with StatReloaderPerforming system checks...System check identified no issues (0 silenced).You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until youapply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.Run \\'python manage.py migrate\\' to apply them.October 27, 2022 - 13:03:14Django version 4.1.2, using settings \\'my_tennis_club.settings\\'Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.Open a new browser window and type 127.0.0.1:8000 in the address bar.The result:What\\'s Next?We have a Django project!The next step is to make an app in your project.You cannot have a web page created with Django without an app.-----Django Create AppWhat is an App?An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.In this tutorial we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.But first, let\\'s just create a simple Django app that displays \"Hello World!\".Create AppI will name my app members.Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, inmy case the my_tennis_club folder, and run the command below.If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press [CTRL] [BREAK], or [CTRL] [C] to stop the server and you should be back in the virtual environment.py manage.py startapp membersDjango creates a folder named members in my project, with this content:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/        migrations/            __init__.py        __init__.py        admin.py        apps.py        models.py        tests.py        views.pyThese are all files and folders with a specific meaning. You will learn about most of them later in this tutorial.First, take a look at the file called views.py.This is where we gather the information we need to send back a proper response.You will learn more about views in the next chapter.-----Django ViewsViewsDjango views are Python functions that takes http requests and returns http response, like HTML documents.A web page that uses Django is full of views with different tasks and missions.Views are usually put in a file called views.py located on your app\\'s folder.There is a views.py in your members folder that looks like this:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render# Create your views here.Find it and open it, and replace the content with this:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.shortcuts import renderfrom django.http import HttpResponsedef members(request):    return HttpResponse(\"Hello world!\")Note: The name of the view does not have to be the same as the application.I call it members because I think it fits well in this context.This is a simple example on how to send a response back to the browser.But how can we execute the view? Well, we must call the view via a URL.You will learn about URLs in the next chapter.-----Django URLsURLsCreate a file named urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file, and type this code in it:my_tennis_club/members/urls.py:from django.urls import pathfrom . import viewsurlpatterns = [    path(\\'members/\\', views.members, name=\\'members\\'),]The urls.py file you just created is specific for the members application. We have to do some routing in the root directory my_tennis_club as well. This may seem complicated, but for now, just follow the instructions below.There is a file called urls.py on the my_tennis_club folder, open that file and add the include module in the import statement, and also add a path() function in the urlpatterns[] list, with arguments that will route users that comes in via 127.0.0.1:8000/.Then your file will look like this:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/urls.py:from django.contrib import adminfrom django.urls import include, pathurlpatterns = [    path(\\'\\', include(\\'members.urls\\')),    path(\\'admin/\\', admin.site.urls),]  If the server is not running, navigate to the /my_tennis_club folder and executethis command in the command prompt:py manage.py runserverIn the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/members/ in the address bar.-----Django TemplatesTemplatesIn the Django Intro page, we learned that the result should be in HTML, and it should be created in a template, so let\\'s do that.Create a templates folder inside the members folder, and create a HTML file named myfirst.html.The file structure should be like this:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/        templates/            myfirst.htmlOpen the HTML file and insert the following:my_tennis_club/members/templates/myfirst.html:Hello World!Welcome to my first Django project!Modify the ViewOpen the views.py file and replace the members view with this:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderdef members(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'myfirst.html\\')  return HttpResponse(template.render())Change SettingsTo be able to work with more complicated stuff than \"Hello World!\", We have to tell Django that a new app is created.This is done in the settings.py file in the my_tennis_club folder.Look up the INSTALLED_APPS[] list and add the members app like this:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:INSTALLED_APPS = [    \\'django.contrib.admin\\',    \\'django.contrib.auth\\',    \\'django.contrib.contenttypes\\',    \\'django.contrib.sessions\\',    \\'django.contrib.messages\\',    \\'django.contrib.staticfiles\\',    \\'members\\'] Then run this command:py manage.py migrateWhich will produce this output:Operations to perform:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessionsRunning migrations:  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

COMMIT;-----Django Insert DataAdd RecordsThe Members table created in the previous chapter is empty.We will use the Python interpreter (Python shell) to add some members to it.To open a Python shell, type this command:py manage.py shellNow we are in the shell, the result should be something like this:Python 3.9.2 (tags/v3.9.2:1a79785, Feb 19 2021, 13:44:55) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.(InteractiveConsole)>>>At the bottom, after the three >>> write the following:>>> from members.models import MemberHit [enter] and write this to look at the empty Member table:>>> Member.objects.all()This should give you an empty QuerySet object, like this:A QuerySet is a collection of data from a database.Read more about QuerySets in the Django QuerySet chapter.Add a record to the table, by executing these two lines:>>> member = Member(firstname=\\'Emil\\', lastname=\\'Refsnes\\')>>> member.save()Execute this command to see if the Member table got a member:>>> Member.objects.all().values()Hopefully, the result will look like this:Add Multiple RecordsYou can add multiple records by making a list of Member objects, and execute .save() on each entry:>>> member1 = Member(firstname=\\'Tobias\\', lastname=\\'Refsnes\\')>>> member2 = Member(firstname=\\'Linus\\', lastname=\\'Refsnes\\')>>> member3 = Member(firstname=\\'Lene\\', lastname=\\'Refsnes\\')>>> member4 = Member(firstname=\\'Stale\\', lastname=\\'Refsnes\\')>>> member5 = Member(firstname=\\'Jane\\', lastname=\\'Doe\\')>>> members_list = [member1, member2, member3, member4, member5]>>> for x in members_list:>>>   x.save()Now there are 6 members in the Member table:>>> Member.objects.all().values()-----Django Update DataUpdate RecordsTo update records that are already in the database, we first have to get the record we want to update:>>> from members.models import Member>>> x = Member.objects.all()[4]x will now represent the member at index 4, which is \"Stale Refsnes\", but to make sure, let us see if that is correct:>>> x.firstnameThis should give you this result:\\'Stale\\'Now we can change the values of this record:>>> x.firstname = \"Stalikken\">>> x.save()Execute this command to see if the Member table got updated:>>> Member.objects.all().values()Hopefully, the result will look like this:-----Django Delete DataDelete RecordsTo delete a record in a table, start by getting the record you want to delete:>>> from members.models import Member>>> x = Member.objects.all()[5]x will now represent the member at index 5, which is \"Jane Doe\", but to make sure, let us see if that is correct:>>> x.firstnameThis should give you this result:\\'Jane\\'Now we can delete the record:>>> x.delete()The result will be:(1, \\'members.Member\\': 1)Which tells us how many items were deleted, and from which Model.If we look at the Member Model, we can see that \\'Jane Doe\\' is removed from the Model:>>> Member.objects.all().values()-----Django Update ModelAdd Fields in the ModelTo add a field to a table after it is created, open the models.py file, and makeyour changes:my_tennis_club/members/models.py:from django.db import modelsclass Member(models.Model):  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  phone = models.IntegerField()  joined_date = models.DateField()As you can see, we want to add phone and joined_date to our Member Model.This is a change in the Model\\'s structure, and therefor we have to make a migration to tell Django that it has to update the database:py manage.py makemigrations membersWhich, in my case, will result in a prompt, because I try to add fields that arenot allowed to be null, to a table that already contains records.As you can see, Django asks if I want to provide the fields with a specific value, or if I want to stop the migration and fix it in the model:py manage.py makemigrations membersYou are trying to add a non-nullable field \\'joined_date\\' to members without a default; we can\\'t do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).Please select a fix: 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column) 2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.pySelect an option:I will select option 2, and open the models.py file again and allow NULL values for the two new fields:my_tennis_club/members/models.py:from django.db import modelsclass Member(models.Model):  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  phone = models.IntegerField(null=True)  joined_date = models.DateField(null=True)And make the migration once again:py manage.py makemigrations membersWhich will result in this:Migrations for \\'members\\':  members\\\\migrations\\\\0002_member_joined_date_member_phone.py    - Add field joined_date to member    - Add field phone to memberRun the migrate command:py manage.py migrateWhich will result in this output:Operations to perform:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, members, sessionsRunning migrations:  Applying members.0002_member_joined_date_member_phone... OK(myworld) C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\my_tennis_club>Insert DataWe can insert data to the two new fields with the same approach as we did in theUpdate Data chapter:First we enter the Python Shell:py manage.py shellNow we are in the shell, the result should be something like this:Python 3.9.2 (tags/v3.9.2:1a79785, Feb 19 2021, 13:44:55) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.(InteractiveConsole)>>>At the bottom, after the three >>> write the following (and hit [enter] for eachline):>>> from members.models import Member>>> x = Member.objects.all()[0]>>> x.phone = 5551234>>> x.joined_date = \\'2022-01-05\\'>>> x.save()This will insert a phone number and a date in the Member Model, at least for thefirst record, the four remaining records will for now be left empty. We will deal with them later in the tutorial.Execute this command to see if the Member table got updated:>>> Member.objects.all().values()The result should look like this:-----Django Prepare TemplateCreate TemplateAfter creating Models, with the fields and data we want in them, it is time to display the data in a web page.Start by creating an HTML file named all_members.html and place it in the /templates/ folder:my_tennis_club/members/templates/all_members.html:Members    % for x in mymembers %     x.firstname   x.lastname   % endfor %Do you see the % % brackets inside the HTML document?They are Django Tags, telling Django to perform some programming logic inside these brackets.You will learn more about Django Tags in our Django Tags chapter.Modify ViewNext we need to make the model data available in the template. This is done in the view.In the view we have to import the Member model, and send it to the template likethis:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef members(request):  mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'all_members.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mymembers,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))The members view does the following:Creates a mymembers object with all the values of the Member model.Loads the all_members.html template.Creates an object containing the mymembers object.Sends the object to the template.Outputs the HTML that is rendered by the template.The ResultWe have created an example so that you can see the result:If you have followed all the steps on your own computer, you can see the result in your own browser:Start the server by navigating to the /my_tennis_club/ folder and execute this command:py manage.py runserverIn the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/members/ in the address bar.-----Django Add Link to DetailsDetails TemplateThe next step in our web page will be to add a Details page, where we can list more details about a specific member.Start by creating a new template called details.html:my_tennis_club/members/templates/details.html: mymember.firstname   mymember.lastname   Phone:  mymember.phone Member since:  mymember.joined_date Back to MembersAdd Link in all-members TemplateThe list in all_members.html should be clickable, and take you to the details page with the ID of the member you clicked on:my_tennis_club/members/templates/all_members.html:Members    % for x in mymembers %     x.firstname   x.lastname   % endfor %Create new ViewThen create a new view in the views.py file, that will deal with incoming requests to the /details/ url:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef members(request):  mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'all_members.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mymembers,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))  def details(request, id):  mymember = Member.objects.get(id=id)  template = loader.get_template(\\'details.html\\')  context =     \\'mymember\\': mymember,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))       The details view does the following:Gets the id as an argument.Uses the id to locate the correct record in the Member table.loads the details.html template.Creates an object containing the member.Sends the object to the template.Outputs the HTML that is rendered by the template.Add URLsNow we need to make sure that the /details/ url points to the correct view, withid as a parameter.Open the urls.py file and add the details view to the urlpatterns list:my_tennis_club/members/urls.py:from django.urls import pathfrom . import viewsurlpatterns = [    path(\\'members/\\', views.members, name=\\'members\\'),    path(\\'members/details/\\', views.details, name=\\'details\\'),] If you have followed all the steps on your own computer, you can see the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/members/.If the server is down, you have to start it again with the runserver command:py manage.py runserver-----Django Add Master TemplateThe extends TagIn the previous pages we created two templates, one for listing all members, andone for details about a member.The templates have a set of HTML code that are the same for both templates.Django provides a way of making a \"parent template\" that you can include in all pages to do the stuff that is the same in all pages.Start by creating a template called master.html, with all the necessary HTML elements:MasterGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/members/templates/master.html:  % block title %% endblock %% block content %% endblock %Do you see Django block Tag inside the  element, and the  element?They are placeholders, telling Django to replace this block with content from other sources.Modify TemplatesNow the two templates (all_members.html and details.html) can use this master.html template.This is done by including the master template with the % extends % tag, and inserting a title block and a content block:Membersmy_tennis_club/members/templates/all_members.html:% extends \"master.html\" %% block title %  My Tennis Club - List of all members% endblock %% block content %  Members        % for x in mymembers %       x.firstname   x.lastname     % endfor %  % endblock %Detailsmy_tennis_club/members/templates/details.html:% extends \"master.html\" %% block title %  Details about  mymember.firstname   mymember.lastname % endblock %% block content %   mymember.firstname   mymember.lastname     Phone  mymember.phone   Member since:  mymember.joined_date     Back to Members  % endblock %If you have followed all the steps on your own computer, you can see the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/members/.If the server is down, you have to start it again with the runserver command:py manage.py runserver-----Django Add Main Index PageMain Index PageOur project needs a main page.The main page will be the landing page when someone visits the root folder of the project.Now, you get an error when visiting the root folder of your project:127.0.0.1:8000/.Start by creating a template called main.html:MainGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/members/templates/main.html:% extends \"master.html\" %% block title %  My Tennis Club% endblock %% block content %  My Tennis Club  Members    Check out all our members  % endblock %Create new ViewThen create a new view called main, that will deal with incoming requests to root of the project:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef members(request):  mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'all_members.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mymembers,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))  def details(request, id):  mymember = Member.objects.get(id=id)  template = loader.get_template(\\'details.html\\')  context =     \\'mymember\\': mymember,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))  def main(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'main.html\\')  return HttpResponse(template.render())       The main view does the following:loads the main.html template.Outputs the HTML that is rendered by the template.Add URLNow we need to make sure that the root url points to the correct view.Open the urls.py file and add the main view to the urlpatterns list:my_tennis_club/members/urls.py:from django.urls import pathfrom . import viewsurlpatterns = [    path(\\'\\', views.main, name=\\'main\\'),    path(\\'members/\\', views.members, name=\\'members\\'),    path(\\'members/details/\\', views.details, name=\\'details\\'),] Add Link Back to MainThe members page is missing a link back to the main page, so let us add that in the all_members.html template, in the content block:Examplemy_tennis_club/members/templates/all_members.html:% extends \"master.html\" %% block title %  My Tennis Club - List of all members% endblock %% block content %  HOME  Members        % for x in mymembers %       x.firstname   x.lastname     % endfor %  % endblock % If you have followed all the steps on your own computer, you can see the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/.If the server is down, you have to start it again with the runserver command:py manage.py runserver-----Django 404 (page not found)Page Not FoundIf you try to access a page that does not exist (a 404 error), Django directs you to a built-in view that handles 404 errors.You will learn how to customize this 404 view later in this chapter, but first, just try to request a page that does not exist.In the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/masfdfg/ in the address bar.You will get one of two results:1:2:If you got the first result, you got directed to the built-in Django 404 template.If you got the second result, then DEBUG is set to True in your settings, and you must set it to False to get directed to the 404 template.This is done in the settings.py file, which is located in the project folder, inour case the my_tennis_club folder, where you also have to specify the host namefrom where your project runs from:ExampleGet your own Django ServerSet the debug property to False, and allow the project to run from your local host:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..# SECURITY WARNING: don\\'t run with debug turned on in production!DEBUG = FalseALLOWED_HOSTS = [\\'*\\']..Important: When DEBUG = False, Django requires you to specify the hosts you willallow this Django project to run from.In production, this should be replaced with a proper domain name:ALLOWED_HOSTS = [\\'yourdomain.com\\']In the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/masfdfg/ in the address bar, and you will get the built-in 404 template:Customize the 404 TemplateDjango will look for a file named 404.html in the templates folder, and display it when there is a 404 error.If no such file exists, Django shows the \"Not Found\" that you saw in the exampleabove.To customize this message, all you have to do is to create a file in the templates folder and name it 404.html, and fill it with whatever you want:my_tennis_club/members/templates/404.html:Wrong addressOoops!I cannot find the file you requested!In the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/masfdfg/ in the address bar, and you will get the customized 404 template:-----Django Add Test ViewTest ViewWhen testing different aspects of Django, it can be a good idea to have somewhere to test code without destroying the main project.This is optional off course, but if you like to follow all steps in this tutorial, you should add a test view that is exactly like the one we create below.Then you can follow the examples and try them out on your own computer.Add ViewStart by adding a view called \"testing\" in the views.py file:my_tennis_club/members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef members(request):  mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'all_members.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mymembers,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))  def details(request, id):  mymember = Member.objects.get(id=id)  template = loader.get_template(\\'details.html\\')  context =     \\'mymember\\': mymember,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))  def main(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'main.html\\')  return HttpResponse(template.render())def testing(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'fruits\\': [\\'Apple\\', \\'Banana\\', \\'Cherry\\'],       return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))      URLsWe have to make sure that incoming urls to /testing/ will be redirected to the testing view.This is done in the urls.py file in the members folder:my_tennis_club/members/urls.py:from django.urls import pathfrom . import viewsurlpatterns = [    path(\\'\\', views.main, name=\\'main\\'),    path(\\'members/\\', views.members, name=\\'members\\'),    path(\\'members/details/\\', views.details, name=\\'details\\'),    path(\\'testing/\\', views.testing, name=\\'testing\\'),    ] Test TemplateWe also need a template where we can play around with HTML and Django code.You might noticed that there was a reference to a template in the testing view?Create a template called \"template.html\" in the templates folder:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/        templates/            404.html            all_members.html            details.html            main.html            master.html            myfirst.html            template.htmlOpen the template.html file and insert the following:my_tennis_club/members/templates/template.html:% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %In views.py you can see what the fruits variable looks like.If the server is not running, navigate to the /my_tennis_club folder and executethis command in the command prompt:py manage.py runserverIn the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/testing/ in the address bar.The result should be like this:-----Django AdminDjango AdminDjango Admin is a really great tool in Django, it is actually a CRUD* user interface of all your models!*CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete.It is free and comes ready-to-use with Django:Getting StartedTo enter the admin user interface, start the server by navigating to the /myworld folder and execute this command:py manage.py runserverIn the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in the address bar.The result should look like this:The reason why this URL goes to the Django admin log in page can be found in theurls.py file of your project:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/urls.py:from django.contrib import adminfrom django.urls import include, pathurlpatterns = [    path(\\'\\', include(\\'members.urls\\')),    path(\\'admin/\\', admin.site.urls),] The urlpatterns[] list takes requests going to admin/ and sends them to admin.site.urls, which is part of a built-in application that comes with Django,and contains a lot of functionality and user interfaces, one of them being the log-in user interface.-----Django Admin - Create UserCreate UserTo be able to log into the admin application, we need to create a user.This is done by typing this command in the command view:py manage.py createsuperuserWhich will give this prompt:Username:Here you must enter: username, e-mail address, (you can just pick a fake e-mail address), and password:Username: johndoeEmail address: johndoe@dummymail.comPassword:Password (again):This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.This password is too common.This password is entirely numeric.Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]:My password did not meet the criteria, but this is a test environment, and I choose to create user anyway, by enter y:Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: yIf you press [Enter], you should have successfully created a user:Superuser created successfully.Now start the server again:py manage.py runserverIn the browser window, type 127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in the address bar.And fill in the form with the correct username and password:Which should result in this user interface:Here you can create, read, update, and delete groups and users, but where is theMembers model?Missing ModelThe Members model is missing, as it should be, you have to tell Django which models that should be visible in the admin interface.You will learn how to include the Members model in the next chapter.-----Django Admin - Include MemberInclude Member in the Admin InterfaceTo include the Member model in the admin interface, we have to tell Django that this model should be visible in the admin interface.This is done in a file called admin.py, and is located in your app\\'s folder, which in our case is the members folder.Open it, and it should look like this:my_tennis_club/members/admin.py:from django.contrib import admin# Register your models here.Insert a couple of lines here to make the Member model visible in the admin page:my_tennis_club/members/admin.py:from django.contrib import adminfrom .models import Member# Register your models here.admin.site.register(Member)Now go back to the browser and you should get this result:Click Members and see the five records we inserted earlier in this tutorial:Change DisplayIn the list in the screenshot above, we see \"Member object (1)\", \"Member object (2)\" etc. which might not be the data you wanted to be displayed in the list.It would be better to display \"firstname\" and \"lastname\" instead.This can easily be done by changing some settings in the models.py and/or the admin.py files. You will learn more about this in the next chapter.-----Django Admin - Set Fields to DisplayMake the List Display More Reader-FriendlyWhen you display a Model as a list, Django displays each record as the string representation of the record object, which in our case is \"Member object (1)\", \"Member object(2)\" etc.:To change this to a more reader-friendly format, we have two choices:Change the string representation function, __str__() of the Member ModelSet the list_details property of the Member ModelChange the String Representation FunctionTo change the string representation, we have to define the __str__() function ofthe Member Model in models.py, like this:my_tennis_club/members/models.py:from django.db import modelsclass Member(models.Model):  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)  phone = models.IntegerField(null=True)  joined_date = models.DateField(null=True)  def __str__(self):    return f\"self.firstname self.lastname\"  Which gives us this result:Defining our own __str__() function is not a Django feature, it is how to changethe string representation of objects in Python. Read more about Python objects in our Python object tutorial.Set list_displayWe can control the fields to display by specifying them in in a list_display property in the admin.py file.First create a MemberAdmin() class and specify the list_display tuple, like this:my_tennis_club/members/admin.py:from django.contrib import adminfrom .models import Member# Register your models here.class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):  list_display = (\"firstname\", \"lastname\", \"joined_date\",)  admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)    Remember to add the MemberAdmin as an argumet in the admin.site.register(Member,MemberAdmin).Now go back to the browser and you should get this result:-----Django Admin - Update MembersUpdate MembersNow we are able to create, update, and delete members in our database, and we start by giving them all a date for when they became members.Click the first member, Stalikken, to open the record for editing, and give him a joined_date:While we are in here, let us give him a phone number as well:Click \"SAVE\" and go back to the list of all members:Repeat these steps and give all members a date and a phone number, and end up with a list like this:-----Django Admin - Add MembersAdd MembersTo add a new member, click on the \"ADD MEMBERS\" button in the top right corner:   You will get an empty form where you can fill in the members fields:Fill in the fields and click \"SAVE\":Now the Members Model have 6 members:-----Django Admin - Delete MembersDelete MembersTo delete a new member, you can either select a member and choose the action \"Delete selected members\" like this:Or you can open a member for editing, and click the red DELETE button at the bottom, like this:-----Django Template VariablesTemplate VariablesIn Django templates, you can render variables by putting them inside   brackets:ExampleGet your own Django Servertemplates/template.html:Hello  firstname , how are you?Create Variable in ViewThe variable firstname in the example above was sent to the template via a view:views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderdef testing(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'firstname\\': \\'Linus\\',    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))As you can see in the view above, we create an object named context and fill it with data, and send it as the first parameter in the template.render() function.Create Variables in TemplateYou can also create variables directly in the template, by using the % with % template tag.The variable is available until the % endwith % tag appears:Exampletemplates/template.html:% with firstname=\"Tobias\" %Hello  firstname , how are you?% endwith %You will learn more about template tags in the next chapter.Data From a ModelThe example above showed a easy approach on how to create and use variables in atemplate.Normally, most of the external data you want to use in a template, comes from a model.We have created a model in the previous chapters, called Member, which we will use in many examples in the next chapters of this tutorial.To get data from the Member model, we will have to import it in the views.py file, and extract data from it in the view:members/views.py:from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirectfrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef testing(request):  mymembers = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mymembers,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))Now we can use the data in the template:templates/template.html:  % for x in mymembers %     x.firstname   % endfor %We use the Django template tag % for % to loop through the members.You will learn more about template tags in the next chapter.-----Django Template TagsTemplate TagsIn Django templates, you can perform programming logic like executing if statements and for loops.These keywords, if and for, are called \"template tags\" in Django.To execute template tags, we surround them in % % brackets.ExampleGet your own Django Servertemplates/template.html:% if greeting == 1 %  Hello% else %  Bye% endif %Django CodeThe template tags are a way of telling Django that here comes something else than plain HTML.The template tags allows us to to do some programming on the server before sending HTML to the client.templates/template.html:  % for x in mymembers %     x.firstname   % endfor %In the next chapters you will learn about the most common template tags.Tag ReferenceA list of all template tags:TagDescriptionautoescapeSpecifies if autoescape mode is on or offblockSpecifies a block sectioncommentSpecifies a comment sectioncsrf_tokenProtects forms from Cross Site Request ForgeriescycleSpecifies content to use in each cycle of a loopdebugSpecifies debugging informationextendsSpecifies a parent templatefilterFilters content before returning itfirstofReturns the first not empty variableforSpecifies a for loopifSpecifies a if statementifchangedUsed in for loops.

Well, if you have two objects that points to the same object, then the is operator evaluates to true:We will demonstrate this by using the % with % tag, which allows us to create variables in the template:Example% with var1=x var2=x %  % if var1 is var2 %    YES  % else %    NO  % endif %% endwith %is notTo check if two objects are not the same.Example% if x is not y %  YES% else %  NO% endif % -----Django for TagFor LoopsA for loop is used for iterating over a sequence, like looping over items in an array, a list, or a dictionary.ExampleGet your own Django ServerLoop through the items of a list:% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %ExampleLoop through a list of dictionaries:% for x in cars %   x.brand    x.model    x.year % endfor % Data From a ModelData in a model is like a table with rows and columns.The Member model we created earlier has five rows, and each row has three columns: id  firstname  lastname  phone  joined_date  1  Emil  Refsnes  5551234  2022-01-05  2  Tobias

QuerySet object, with a similarformat as the cars example above: a list with dictionaries: ExampleLoop through items fetched from a database:% for x in members %   x.id        x.firstname      x.lastname   % endfor % ReversedThe reversed keyword is used when you want to do the loop in reversed order.Example% for x in members reversed %   x.id        x.firstname      x.lastname   % endfor %  EmptyThe empty keyword can be used if you want to do something special if the object is empty.Example  % for x in emptytestobject %     x.firstname   % empty %    No members  % endfor % The empty keyword can also be used if the object does not exist:Example  % for x in myobject %     x.firstname   % empty %    No members  % endfor % Loop VariablesDjango has some variables that are available for you inside a loop:forloop.counterforloop.counter0forloop.firstforloop.lastforloop.parentloopforloop.revcounterforloop.revcounter0forloop.counterThe current iteration, starting at 1.Example  % for x in fruits %     forloop.counter   % endfor % forloop.counter0The current iteration, starting at 0.Example  % for x in fruits %     forloop.counter0   % endfor % forloop.firstAllows you to test if the loop is on its first iteration.ExampleDraw a blue background for the first iteration of the loop:  % for x in fruits %     x   % endfor % forloop.lastAllows you to test if the loop is on its last iteration.ExampleDraw a blue background for the last iteration of the loop:  % for x in fruits %     x   % endfor % forloop.revcounterThe current iteration if you start at the end and count backwards, ending up at 1.Example  % for x in fruits %     forloop.revcounter   % endfor % forloop.revcounter0The current iteration if you start at the end and count backwards, ending up at 0.Example  % for x in fruits %     forloop.revcounter0   % endfor % -----Django comment TagCommentsComments allows you to have sections of code that should be ignored.ExampleGet your own Django ServerWelcome Everyone% comment %  Welcome ladies and gentlemen% endcomment %Comment DescriptionYou can add a message to your comment, to help you remember why you wrote the comment, or as message to other people reading the code.ExampleAdd a description to your comment:Welcome Everyone% comment \"this was the original welcome message\" %    Welcome ladies and gentlemen% endcomment %Smaller CommentsYou can also use the # ... # tags when commenting out code, which can be easier for smaller comments:ExampleComment out the word Everyone:Welcome# Everyone#Comment in ViewsViews are written in Python, and Python comments are written with the # character:ExampleComment out a section in the view:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderdef testing(request):  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  #context =   # \\'var1\\': \\'John\\',  #  return HttpResponse(template.render())Read more about Python Comments in out Python Comment Tutorial.-----Django include TagIncludeThe include tag allows you to include a template inside the current template.This is useful when you have a block of content that is the same for many pages.ExampleGet your own Django Servertemplates/footer.html:You have reached the bottom of this page, thank you for your time.templates/template.html:HelloThis page contains a footer in a template.% include \\'footer.html\\' % Variables in IncludeYou can send variables into the template by using the with keyword.In the include file, you refer to the variables by using the  variablename  syntax:Exampletemplates/mymenu.html:HOME |  me  | ABOUT | FORUM |  sponsor templates/template.html:% include \"mymenu.html\" with me=\"TOBIAS\" sponsor=\"W3SCHOOLS\" %WelcomeThis is my webpage -----Django QuerySetDjango QuerySetA QuerySet is a collection of data from a database.A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects.QuerySets makes it easier to get the data you actually need, by allowing you to filter and order the data at an early stage.In this tutorial we will be querying data from the Member table.Member: id  firstname  lastname  phone  joined_date  1  Emil  Refsnes  5551234  2022-01-05  2  Tobias  Refsnes  5557777  2022-04-01  3  Linus  Refsnes  5554321  2021-12-24  4  Lene  Refsnes  5551234  2021-05-01  5  Stalikken  Refsnes  5559876  2022-09-29 Querying DataIn views.py, we have a view for testing called testing where we will test different queries.In the example below we use the .all() method to get all the records and fields of the Member model:ViewGet your own Django Serverviews.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef testing(request):  mydata = Member.objects.all()  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mydata,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))The object is placed in a variable called mydata, and is sent to the template via the context object as mymembers, and looks like this:,  ,  ,  ,  ]>As you can see, our Member model contains 5 records, and are listed inside the QuerySet as 5 objects.In the template you can use the mymembers object to generate content:Templatetemplates/template.html:      ID    Firstname    Lastname    % for x in mymembers %           x.id          x.firstname        x.lastname       % endfor %-----Django QuerySet - Get DataGet DataThere are different methods to get data from a model into a QuerySet.The values() MethodThe values() method allows you to return each object as a Python dictionary, with the names and values as key/value pairs:ExampleGet your own Django Serverviews.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef testing(request):  mydata = Member.objects.all().values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mydata,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))Return Specific ColumnsThe values_list() method allows you to return only the columns that you specify.ExampleReturn only the firstname columns:views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef testing(request):  mydata = Member.objects.values_list(\\'firstname\\')  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mydata,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))Return Specific RowsYou can filter the search to only return specific rows/records, by using the filter() method.ExampleReturn only the records where firstname is \\'Emil\\'views.py:from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberdef testing(request):  mydata = Member.objects.filter(firstname=\\'Emil\\').values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mydata,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))You will learn more about the filter() method in the next chapter.-----Django QuerySet - FilterQuerySet FilterThe filter() method is used to filter your search, and allows you to return onlythe rows that matches the search term.As we learned in the previous chapter, we can filter on field names like this:ExampleGet your own Django ServerReturn only the records where the firstname is \\'Emil\\':mydata = Member.objects.filter(firstname=\\'Emil\\').values()In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members WHERE firstname = \\'Emil\\';ANDThe filter() method takes the arguments as **kwargs (keyword arguments), so you can filter on more than one field by separating them by a comma.ExampleReturn records where lastname is \"Refsnes\" and id is 2:mydata = Member.objects.filter(lastname=\\'Refsnes\\', id=2).values()In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members WHERE lastname = \\'Refsnes\\' AND id = 2;ORTo return records where firstname is Emil or firstname is Tobias (meaning: returning records that matches either query, not necessarily both) is not as easy as the AND example above.We can use multiple filter() methods, separated by a pipe | character. The results will merge into one model.ExampleReturn records where firstname is either \"Emil\" or Tobias\":mydata = Member.objects.filter(firstname=\\'Emil\\').values() | Member.objects.filter(firstname=\\'Tobias\\').values()Another common method is to import and use Q expressions:ExampleReturn records where firstname is either \"Emil\" or Tobias\":from django.http import HttpResponsefrom django.template import loaderfrom .models import Memberfrom django.db.models import Qdef testing(request):  mydata = Member.objects.filter(Q(firstname=\\'Emil\\') | Q(firstname=\\'Tobias\\')).values()  template = loader.get_template(\\'template.html\\')  context =     \\'mymembers\\': mydata,    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members WHERE firstname = \\'Emil\\' OR firstname = \\'Tobias\\';Field LookupsDjango has its own way of specifying SQL statements and WHERE clauses.To make specific where clauses in Django, use \"Field lookups\".Field lookups are keywords that represents specific SQL keywords.Example:Use the __startswith keyword:.filter(firstname__startswith=\\'L\\');Is the same as the SQL statement:WHERE firstname LIKE \\'L%\\'The above statement will return records where firstname starts with \\'L\\'.Field Lookups SyntaxAll Field lookup keywords must be specified with the fieldname, followed by two(!) underscore characters, and the keyword.In our Member model, the statement would be written like this:ExampleReturn the records where firstname starts with the letter \\'L\\':mydata = Member.objects.filter(firstname__startswith=\\'L\\').values()Field Lookups ReferenceA list of all field look up keywords:KeywordDescriptioncontainsContains the phraseicontainsSame as contains, but case-insensitivedateMatches a datedayMatches a date (day of month, 1-31) (for dates)endswithEnds withiendswithSame as endswidth, but case-insensitiveexactAn exact matchiexactSame as exact, but case-insensitiveinMatches one of the valuesisnullMatches NULL valuesgtGreater thangteGreater than, or equal tohourMatches an hour (for datetimes)ltLess thanlteLess than, or equal tominuteMatches a minute (for datetimes)monthMatches a month (for dates)quarterMatches a quarter of the year (1-4) (for dates)rangeMatch betweenregexMatches a regular expressioniregexSame as regex, but case-insensitivesecondMatches a second (for datetimes)startswithStarts withistartswithSame as startswith, but case-insensitivetimeMatches a time (for datetimes)weekMatches a week number (1-53) (for dates)week_dayMatches a day of week (1-7) 1 is sundayiso_week_day Matches a ISO 8601 day of week (1-7) 1 is mondayyearMatches a year (for dates)iso_yearMatches an ISO 8601 year (for dates)-----Django QuerySet - Order ByOrder ByTo sort QuerySets, Django uses the order_by() method:ExampleGet your own Django ServerOrder the result alphabetically by firstname:mydata = Member.objects.all().order_by(\\'firstname\\').values()In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members ORDER BY firstname;Descending OrderBy default, the result is sorted ascending (the lowest value first), to change the direction to descending (the highest value first), use the minus sign (NOT),- in front of the field name:ExampleOrder the result firstname descending:mydata = Member.objects.all().order_by(\\'-firstname\\').values()In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members ORDER BY firstname DESC;Multiple Order BysTo order by more than one field, separate the fieldnames with a comma in the order_by() method:ExampleOrder the result first by lastname ascending, then descending on id:mydata = Member.objects.all().order_by(\\'lastname\\', \\'-id\\').values()In SQL, the above statement would be written like this:SELECT * FROM members ORDER BY lastname ASC, id DESC;-----Django - Add Static FileCreate Static FolderWhen building web applications, you probably want to add some static files like images or css files.Start by creating a folder named static in your project, the same place where you created the templates folder:The name of the folder has to be static.my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/        templates/        static/Add a CSS file in the static folder, the name is your choice, we will call it myfirst.css in this example:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/        templates/        static/            myfirst.cssOpen the CSS file and insert the following:my_tennis_club/members/static/myfirst.css:body   background-color: lightblue;  font-family: verdana;Modify the TemplateNow you have a CSS file, with some CSS styling. The next step will be to includethis file in a HTML template:Open the HTML file and add the following:% load static %And:ExampleGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/members/templates/template.html:% load static %% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %  Restart the server for the changes to take effect:py manage.py runserverAnd check out the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/testing/.Didn\\'t Work?Just testing? If you just want to play around, and not going to deploy your work, you can set DEBUG = True in the settings.py file, and the example above will work.Plan to deploy? If you plan to deploy your work, you should set DEBUG = False inthe settings.py file. The example above will fail, because Django has no built-in solution for serving static files, but there are other ways to serve static files, you will learn how in the next chapter.Example (in development):my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..# SECURITY WARNING: don\\'t run with debug turned on in production!DEBUG = True..This will make the example work, but we want you to choose DEBUG = False, because that is the best way to learn how to work with Django.Choose Debug = FalseFor the rest of this tutorial, we will run with DEBUG = False, even in development, because that is the best way to learn how to work with Django.Example:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..# SECURITY WARNING: don\\'t run with debug turned on in production!DEBUG = FalseALLOWED_HOSTS = [\\'*\\']..ALLOWED_HOSTSWhen using DEBUG = False you have to specify which host name(s) are allowed to host your work. You could choose \\'127.0.0.1\\' or \\'localhost\\' which both represents the address of your local machine.We choose \\'*\\', which means any address are allowed to host this site. This should be change into a real domain name when you deploy your project to a public server.Didn\\'t Work?That is right, the example still does not work.You will have install a third-party library in order to handle static files.There are many alternatives, we will show you how to use a Python library calledWhiteNoise in the next chapter.-----Django - Installing WhiteNoiseWhiteNoiseDjango does not have a built-in solution for serving static files, at least not in production when DEBUG has to be False.We have to use a third-party solution to accomplish this.In this Tutorial we will use WhiteNoise, which is a Python library, built for serving static files.Install WhiteNoiseTo install WhiteNoise in your virtual environment, type the command below:pip install whitenoiseThe result should be something like this:Collecting whitenoise  Downloading whitenoise-6.2.0-py3-none-any.whl (19 kB)Installing collected packages: whitenoiseSuccessfully installed whitenoise-6.2.0WARNING: You are using pip version 20.2.3; however, version 22.3.1 is available.You should consider upgrading via the \\'c:\\\\users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\scripts\\\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip\\' command.Modify SettingsTo make Django aware of you wanting to run WhitNoise, you have to specify it in the MIDDLEWARE list in settings.py file:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..MIDDLEWARE = [    \\'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\\',    \\'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware\\',    \\'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware\\',    \\'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware\\',    \\'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware\\',    \\'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware\\',    \\'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware\\',    \\'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware\\',].. Collect Static FilesThere are one more action you have to perform before you can serve the static file from the example in the previous chapter. You have to collect all static files and put them into one specified folder. You will learn how in the next chapter.-----Django - Collect Static FilesHandle Static FilesStatic files in your project, like stylesheets, JavaScripts, and images, are nothandled automatically by Django when DEBUG = False.When DEBUG = True, this worked fine, all we had to do was to put them in the static folder of the application.When DEBUG = False, static files have to be collected and put in a specified folder before we can use it.Collect Static FilesTo collect all necessary static files for your project, start by specifying a STATIC_ROOT property in the settings.py file.This specifies a folder where you want to collect your static files.You can call the folder whatever you like, we will call it productionfiles:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / \\'productionfiles\\'STATIC_URL = \\'static/\\'.. You could manually create this folder and collect and put all static files of your project into this folder, but Django has a command that do this for you:py manage.py collectstaticWhich will produce this result:131 static files copied to \\'C:\\\\Users\\\\your_name\\\\myworld\\\\my_tennis_club\\\\productionfiles\\'.131 files? Why so many? Well this is because of the admin user interface, that comes built-in with Django. We want to keep this feature in production, and it comes with a whole bunch of files including stylesheets, fonts, images, and JavaScripts.my_tennis_club    members/    my_tennis_club/    productionfiles/        admin/        myfirst.cssThe Example Should WorkNow you have collected the static files of your project, and if you have installed WhiteNoise, the example from the Add Static Files chapter will finallywork.Start the server and see the result:py manage.py runserverAnd check out the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/testing/.ExampleGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/members/templates/template.html:% load static %% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %-----Django - Global Static FilesAdd a Global CSS FileWe have learned how to add a static file in the application\\'s static folder, andhow to use it in the application.But what if other applications in your project wants to use the file?Then we have to create a folder on the root directory and put the file(s) there.It is not enough to create a static folder in the root directory, and Django will fix the rest. We have to tell Django where to look for these static files.Start by creating a folder on the project\\'s root level, this folder can be called whatever you like, I will call it mystaticfiles in this tutorial:my_tennis_club    db.sqlite3    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/    mystaticfiles/Add a CSS file in the mystaticfiles folder, the name is your choice, we will call it myglobal.css in this example:my_tennis_club    db.sqlite3    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/    mystaticfiles/        myglobal.cssOpen the CSS file and insert the following:my_tennis_club/mystaticfiles/myglobal.css:body   color: violet;Modify SettingsYou will have to tell Django to also look for static files in the mystaticfiles folder in the root directory, this is done in the settings.py file:Add a STATICFILES_DIRS list:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / \\'productionfiles\\'STATIC_URL = \\'static/\\'#Add this in your settings.py file:STATICFILES_DIRS = [    BASE_DIR / \\'mystaticfiles\\']..   In the STATICFILES_DIRS list, you can list all the directories where Django should look for static files.The BASE_DIR keyword represents the root directory of the project, and together with the / \"mystaticfiles\", it means the mystaticfiles folder in the root directory.Search OrderIf you have files with the same name, Django will use the first occurrence of the file.The search starts in the directories listed in STATICFILES_DIRS, using the orderyou have provided. Then, if the file is not found, the search continues in the static folder of each application.Modify the TemplateNow you have a global CSS file for the entire project, which can be accessed from all your applications.To use it in a template, use the same syntax as you did for the myfirst.css file:Begin the template with the following:% load static %And refer to the file like this:ExampleGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/members/templates/template.html:% load static %% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %  Didn\\'t Work?That is correct. You need to collect the static files once again.Collect Static FilesRun the collectstatic command to collect the new static file:py manage.py collectstaticWhich will produce this result:You have requested to collect static files at the destinationlocation as specified in your settings:    C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\my_tennis_club\\\\productionfilesThis will overwrite existing files!Are you sure you want to do this?Type \\'yes\\' to continue, or \\'no\\' to cancel:Type yes:Type \\'yes\\' to continue, or \\'no\\' to cancel: yesWhich will produce this result:1 static file copied to \\'C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\my_tennis_club\\\\productionfiles\\', 131 unmodified.The Example Should WorkStart the server, and the example will work:py manage.py runserverCheck out the result in your own browser: 127.0.0.1:8000/testing/.Examplemy_tennis_club/members/templates/template.html:% load static %% for x in fruits %   x % endfor %-----Add CSS File to the ProjectThe Project - My Tennis ClubIf you have followed the steps in the entire Django tutorial, you will have a my_tennis_club project on your computer, with 5 members:We want to add a stylesheet to this project, and put it in the mystaticfiles folder:my_tennis_club    manage.py    my_tennis_club/    members/    mystaticfiles/        mystyles.cssThe name of the CSS file is your choice, we call it mystyles.css in this project.Open the CSS file and insert the following:my_tennis_club/mystaticfiles/mystyles.css:body   background-color: violet;Modify the Master TemplateNow you have a css file, the next step will be to include this file in the master template:Open the master template file and add the following:my_tennis_club/members/templates/master.html:% load static %  % block title %% endblock %    % block content %% endblock %  Check SettingsMake sure your settings.py file contains a STATICFILES_DIRS list with a reference to the mystaticfiles folder on the root directory, and that you have specified a STATICFILES_ROOT folder:my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / \\'productionfiles\\'STATIC_URL = \\'static/\\'#Add this in your settings.py file:STATICFILES_DIRS = [    BASE_DIR / \\'mystaticfiles\\']..Collect Static FilesEvery time you make a change in a static file, you must run the collectstatic command to make the changes take effect:py manage.py collectstaticIf you have executed the command earlier in the project, Django will prompt you with a question:You have requested to collect static files at the destinationlocation as specified in your settings:    C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\my_tennis_club\\\\productionfilesThis will overwrite existing files!Are you sure you want to do this?Type \\'yes\\' to continue, or \\'no\\' to cancel:Type \\'yes\\'.

Make sure you are still inn the virtual environment:pip install psycopg2-binaryThe result should be something like this:Collecting psycopg2-binary  Downloading psycopg2_binary-2.9.5-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl (1.2 MB)    |ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ| 1.2 MB 3.3 MB/s\\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88 \\x96\\x88Installing collected packages: psycopg2-binarySuccessfully installed psycopg2-binary-2.9.5WARNING: You are using pip version 20.2.3; however, version 22.3.1 is available.You should consider upgrading via the \\'c:\\\\users\\\\Your Name\\\\myworld\\\\scripts\\\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip\\' command.The psycopg2 package is a driver that is necessary for PostgreSQL to work in Python.We also need a server where we can host the database.In this tutorial we have chosen the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, you willlearn more about that in the next chapter.-----Create AWS AccountWhy AWS?There are many providers out there that can host Django projects and PostgreSQL databases.In this tutorial we will use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, mainly because they offer a free solution that can host both Django projects and PostgreSQL databases. All you need is an AWS account.Note: you can choose whatever server provider you like, they will most likely all give you a satisfying result, but they will have some provider-specific settings that you should be aware of when following this tutorial.AWSGo to aws.amazon.com, and create an account:Sign InOnce you have created an AWS account, it is time to sign in for the first time:AWS ConsoleIf this is your first time you sign into your AWS account, you will be directed to the AWS Console Home page:Add the RDS ServiceOnce you have an AWS account, you can start creating a database.We will use a database service at AWS, called RDS.In the search field, search for \"RDS\", and click to start the service:Once the service has started, you should see something like this:In the next chapter we will create the PostgreSQL database.-----Create PostgreSQL DatabaseCreate DatabaseInside the RDS service, create a database, either by navigating to the Database section, or just click the \"Create database\" button:SettingsOnce you have started creating a database, you will be given some choices for the type and settings of your database.To add a PostgreSQL database to your Django project, choose the following options:Standard creation method:PostgreSQL engine method:Free Tier Template:Name of database, username, and passwordYou can choose any name, username, and password:Keep the default instance configuration:Check off the storage autoscaling:It can be a good thing to enable storage autoscaling, but for this tutorial it is not necessary.Grant public access, and create a new security group:Give the security group a name, we will call it \"w3-django\":Keep default db authentications:Keep default monitoring:Click Create database:This will take a few minutes, but when it is finished, you will have a new PostgreSQL database, almost ready to run on your Django project!In the next chapter you will learn how to connect your project to the database.-----Connect to DatabaseModify SettingsTo make Django able to connect to your database, you have to specify it in the DATABASES tuple in the settings.py file.Before, it looked like this:SQLiteGet your own Django Servermy_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..DATABASES =     \\'default\\':         \\'ENGINE\\': \\'django.db.backends.sqlite3\\',        \\'NAME\\': BASE_DIR / \\'db.sqlite3\\',    .Now, you should change it to look like this:PostgreSQLmy_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/settings.py:..DATABASES =     \\'default\\':         \\'ENGINE\\': \\'django.db.backends.postgresql\\',        \\'NAME\\': \\'postgres\\',        \\'USER\\': \\'masteruser\\',        \\'PASSWORD\\': \\'12345678\\',        \\'HOST\\': \\'w3-django-project.cdxmgq9zqqlr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\\',        \\'PORT\\': \\'5432\\'    .Note: The values will be different for your project.Engine?As you can see in the settings.py file, we insert postgresql instead of sqlite.Name?The database does not have a name, but you have to assign one in order to accessthe database.If no name is given, the provider accepts \\'postgres\\' as the name of the database.Username and Password?Insert the username and password that you specified when you created the database.Host? Port?As you can see in the settings.py file, we insert postgresql instead of sqlite, and insert the username and password that we specified when we created the database.The HOST and PORT can be found under the \"Connectivity & security\" section in the RDS instance. They are described as \"Endpoint\" and \"Port\":Which for my project is this:\\'HOST\\': \\'w3-django-project.cdxmgq9zqqlr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\\' \\'PORT\\': \\'5432\\'MigrateOnce we have done the changes in settings.py, we must run a migration in our virtual environment, before the changes will take place:py manage.py migrateWhich will give you this result:Operations to perform:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, members, sessionsRunning migrations:  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

In the next chapter we will fill the database with members.-----PostgreSQL - Add MembersMembersThe \"My Tennis Club\" project has no members: 127.0.0.1:8000/.That is because we have created a brand new database, and it is empty.The old SQLite database contained 5 members, so let us dive into the admin interface and add the same 5 members.But first we have to create a new superuser.Create superuserSince we now have a new database, we have to create the superuser once again:This is done by typing this command in the command view:py manage.py createsuperuserWhich will give this prompt:Username:Here you must enter: username, e-mail address, (you can just pick a fake e-mail address), and password:Username: johndoeEmail address: johndoe@dummymail.comPassword:Password (again):This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.This password is too common.This password is entirely numeric.Bypass password validation and create user anyway?

This is often called, \"in development\", and when we have deployedit, we call it \"in production\".Where to Deploy?There are many providers out there that offers servers for Django projects. In this tutorial we will use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, mainly becausethey offer a free solution that only requires you to create an AWS account.Note: you can choose whatever server provider you like, they will all give you the same result, but they will have some provider-specific settings that you should be aware of when following this tutorial.AWSLog into your AWS account. (If you do not have an AWS account, follow the steps in the Create AWS Account chapter.)AWS ConsoleOnce you have signed in, you should be directed to the AWS Console Home page:Elastic BeanstalkWe will be using a service called \"Elastic Beanstalk\" to deploy the Django project.In the search field at the top, search for \"elastic beanstalk\", and click to start the service:Lock in DependenciesOnce you have started the \"Elastic Beanstalk\" service, we could start with the deployment, but first we need to lock in some dependencies, which means to make you local Django project ready for deployment.You will learn how to in the next chapters.-----Deploy Django - Create RequirementsLock in DependenciesWhen you create a Django application, there are some Python packages that your project depends on.Django itself is a Python package, and we have to make sure that the server where we deploy our project also has the Django package installed, and all the other packages your project requires.Luckily there is a command for this as well, just run this command in the command view:py -m pip freeze > requirements.txtThe result of the above command, is a file called requirements.txt being createdin the project:my_tennis_club    members/    my_tennis_club/    mystaticfiles/    productionfiles/    db.sqlite3    manage.py    requirements.txtThe file contains all the packages that this project depends on: with this content:my_tennis_club/requirements.txt:asgiref==3.5.2Django==4.1.4psycopg2-binary==2.9.5sqlparse==0.4.3tzdata==2022.7whitenoise==6.2.0Note: You can create this file on your own, and insert the packages manually, just make sure you get all the packages your project depends on, and you must name the file requirements.txt.Now the hosting provider knows which packages to install when we deploy our project.But Elastic Beanstalk needs more information, go to the next chapter to create an \"EB\" config file.-----Deploy Django - django.configProvider-Specific SettingsWe have chosen AWS as our hosting provider, and Elastic Beanstalk as a service to deploy the Django project, and it has some specific requirements..ebextension FolderIt requires that you create a folder on the root level of your project called .ebextensions:my_tennis_club    .ebextensions/    members/    my_tennis_club/    mystaticfiles/    productionfiles/    db.sqlite3    manage.py    requirements.txtCreate django.config FileIn the .ebextensions folder, create a file called django.config:my_tennis_club    .ebextensions/        django.configOpen the file and insert these settings:my_tennis_club/.ebextensions/django.config:option_settings:  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:    WSGIPath: my_tennis_club.wsgi:applicationNote: These steps are specific for AWS and Elastic beanstalk, but every providerhas some provider-specific settings.The next step is to wrap all the dependencies into one .zip file, which you willlearn in the next chapter.-----Deploy Django Project - Create zip FileZip Your ProjectTo wrap your project into a .zip file, you cannot zip the entire project folder,but choose the files and folders manually.The files to include in the .zip file are highlighted (blue) in the example below:my_tennis_club    .ebextensions/    members/    my_tennis_club/    mystaticfiles/    productionfiles/    db.sqlite3    manage.py    requirements.txtWith your file explorer, navigate to the project folder, select these files and folders, right-click and choose to create a zip file.Zip FileNow you have a .zip file of your project which you can upload to Elastic beanstalk:my_tennis_club    .ebextensions/    members/    my_tennis_club/    mystaticfiles/    productionfiles/    db.sqlite3    manage.py    my_tennis_clup.zip    requirements.txt-----Deploy Django - Elastic BeanstalkElastic BeanstalkIn AWS, navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk application, as we did in the Choose Provider chapter, and click the \"Create application\" button:Create EB ApplicationOnce you have clicked the \"Create Application\" button, you will be taken to thispage, where you can give your Django project a name.

Hunter.Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.Where is the Matplotlib Codebase?The source code for Matplotlib is located at this github repository https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib-----Matplotlib Getting StartedInstallation of MatplotlibIf you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.Install it using this command:C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name>pip install matplotlibIf this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed,  like Anaconda, Spyder etc.Import MatplotlibOnce Matplotlib is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import module statement:import matplotlibNow Matplotlib is imported and ready to use:Checking Matplotlib VersionThe version string is stored under __version__ attribute.ExampleGet your own Python Serverimport matplotlibprint(matplotlib.__version__)Note: two underscore characters are used in __version__.-----Matplotlib PyplotPyplotMost of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot submodule, and are usually imported under the plt alias:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltNow the Pyplot package can be referred to as plt.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw a line in a diagram from position (0,0) to position (6,250):import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npxpoints = np.array([0, 6])ypoints = np.array([0, 250])plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)plt.show()Result:You will learn more about drawing (plotting) in the next chapters.-----Matplotlib PlottingPlotting x and y pointsThe plot() function is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram.By default, the plot() function draws a line from point to point.The function takes parameters for specifying points in the diagram.Parameter 1 is an array containing the points on the x-axis.Parameter 2 is an array containing the points on the y-axis.If we need to plot a line from (1, 3) to (8, 10), we have to pass two arrays [1,8] and [3, 10] to the plot function.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDraw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to position (8, 10):import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npxpoints = np.array([1, 8])ypoints = np.array([3, 10])plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)plt.show()Result:The x-axis is the horizontal axis.The y-axis is the vertical axis.ADVERTISEMENTPlotting Without LineTo plot only the markers, you can use shortcut string notation parameter \\'o\\', which means \\'rings\\'.ExampleDraw two points in the diagram, one at position (1, 3) and one in position (8, 10):import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npxpoints = np.array([1, 8])ypoints = np.array([3, 10])plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints, \\'o\\')plt.show()Result:You will learn more about markers in the next chapter.Multiple PointsYou can plot as many points as you like, just make sure you have the same numberof points in both axis.ExampleDraw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to (2, 8) then to (6, 1) and finally to position (8, 10):import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npxpoints = np.array([1, 2, 6, 8])ypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)plt.show()Result:Default X-PointsIf we do not specify the points on the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3 etc., depending on the length of the y-points.So, if we take the same example as above, and leave out the x-points, the diagram will look like this:ExamplePlotting without x-points:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10, 5, 7])plt.plot(ypoints)plt.show()Result:The x-points in the example above are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].-----Matplotlib MarkersMarkersYou can use the keyword argument marker to emphasize each point with a specifiedmarker:ExampleGet your own Python ServerMark each point with a circle:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\')plt.show()Result:ExampleMark each point with a star:... plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'*\\')...Result:ADVERTISEMENTMarker ReferenceYou can choose any of these markers:MarkerDescription\\'o\\'Circle\\'*\\'Star\\'.\\'Point\\',\\'Pixel\\'x\\'X\\'X\\'X (filled)\\'+\\'Plus\\'P\\'Plus (filled)\\'s\\'Square\\'D\\'Diamond\\'d\\'Diamond (thin)\\'p\\'Pentagon\\'H\\'Hexagon\\'h\\'Hexagon\\'v\\'Triangle Down\\'^\\'Triangle Up\\'\\'Triangle Right\\'1\\'Tri Down\\'2\\'Tri Up\\'3\\'Tri Left\\'4\\'Tri Right\\'|\\'Vline\\'_\\'HlineFormat Strings fmtYou can also use the shortcut string notation parameter to specify the marker.This parameter is also called fmt, and is written with this syntax:marker|line|colorExampleMark each point with a circle:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, \\'o:r\\')plt.show()Result:The marker value can be anything from the Marker Reference above.The line value can be one of the following:Line ReferenceLine SyntaxDescription\\'-\\'Solid line\\':\\'Dotted line\\'--\\'Dashed line\\'-.\\'Dashed/dotted lineNote: If you leave out the line value in the fmt parameter, no line will be plotted.The short color value can be one of the following:Color ReferenceColor Syntax Description\\'r\\'Red\\'g\\'Green\\'b\\'Blue\\'c\\'Cyan\\'m\\'Magenta\\'y\\'Yellow\\'k\\'Black\\'w\\'WhiteMarker SizeYou can use the keyword argument markersize or the shorter version, ms to set the size of the markers:ExampleSet the size of the markers to 20:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20)plt.show()Result:Marker ColorYou can use the keyword argument markeredgecolor or the shorter mec to set the color of the edge of the markers:ExampleSet the EDGE color to red:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20, mec = \\'r\\')plt.show()Result:You can use the keyword argument markerfacecolor or the shorter mfc to set the color inside the edge of the markers:ExampleSet the FACE color to red:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20, mfc = \\'r\\')plt.show()Result:Use both the mec and mfc arguments to color the entire marker:ExampleSet the color of both the edge and the face to red:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20, mec = \\'r\\', mfc = \\'r\\')plt.show()Result:You can also use Hexadecimal color values:ExampleMark each point with a beautiful green color:... plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20, mec = \\'#4CAF50\\', mfc = \\'#4CAF50\\')...Result:Or any of the 140 supported color names.ExampleMark each point with the color named \"hotpink\":... plt.plot(ypoints, marker = \\'o\\', ms = 20, mec = \\'hotpink\\', mfc = \\'hotpink\\')...Result:-----Matplotlib LineLinestyleYou can use the keyword argument linestyle, or shorter ls, to change the style of the plotted line:ExampleGet your own Python ServerUse a dotted line:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, linestyle = \\'dotted\\')plt.show()Result:ExampleUse a dashed line:plt.plot(ypoints, linestyle = \\'dashed\\')Result:ADVERTISEMENTShorter SyntaxThe line style can be written in a shorter syntax:linestyle can be written as ls.dotted can be written as :.dashed can be written as --.ExampleShorter syntax:plt.plot(ypoints, ls = \\':\\')Result:Line StylesYou can choose any of these styles:StyleOr\\'solid\\' (default) \\'-\\'\\'dotted\\'\\':\\'\\'dashed\\'\\'--\\'\\'dashdot\\'\\'-.\\'\\'None\\'\\'\\' or \\' \\'Line ColorYou can use the keyword argument color or the shorter c to set the color of the line:ExampleSet the line color to red:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, color = \\'r\\')plt.show()Result:You can also use Hexadecimal color values:ExamplePlot with a beautiful green line:... plt.plot(ypoints, c = \\'#4CAF50\\')...Result:Or any of the 140 supported color names.ExamplePlot with the color named \"hotpink\":... plt.plot(ypoints, c = \\'hotpink\\')...Result:Line WidthYou can use the keyword argument linewidth or the shorter lw to change the widthof the line.The value is a floating number, in points:ExamplePlot with a 20.5pt wide line:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npypoints = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])plt.plot(ypoints, linewidth = \\'20.5\\')plt.show()Result:Multiple LinesYou can plot as many lines as you like by simply adding more plt.plot() functions:ExampleDraw two lines by specifying a plt.plot() function for each line:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy1 = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])y2 = np.array([6, 2, 7, 11])plt.plot(y1)plt.plot(y2)plt.show()Result:You can also plot many lines by adding the points for the x- and y-axis for eachline in the same plt.plot() function.(In the examples above we only specified the points on the y-axis, meaning that the points on the x-axis got the the default values (0, 1, 2, 3).)The x- and y- values come in pairs:ExampleDraw two lines by specifiyng the x- and y-point values for both lines:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx1 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])y1 = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10])x2 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])y2 = np.array([6, 2, 7, 11])plt.plot(x1, y1, x2, y2)plt.show()Result:-----Matplotlib Labels and TitleCreate Labels for a PlotWith Pyplot, you can use the xlabel() and ylabel() functions to set a label for the x- and y-axis.ExampleGet your own Python ServerAdd labels to the x- and y-axis:import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = np.array([80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125])y = np.array([240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330])plt.plot(x, y)plt.xlabel(\"Average Pulse\")plt.ylabel(\"Calorie

It needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for values on the y-axis:ExampleGet your own Python ServerA simple scatter plot:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:The observation in the example above is the result of 13 cars passing by.The X-axis shows how old the car is.The Y-axis shows the speed of the car when it passes.Are there any relationships between the observations?It seems that the newer the car, the faster it drives, but that could be a coincidence, after all we only registered 13 cars.Compare PlotsIn the example above, there seems to be a relationship between speed and age, but what if we plot the observations from another day as well? Will the scatter plot tell us something else?ExampleDraw two plots on the same figure:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as np#day one, the age and speed of 13 cars:x = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])plt.scatter(x, y)#day two, the age and speed of 15 cars:x = np.array([2,2,8,1,15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12])y = np.array([100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85])plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:Note: The two plots are plotted with two different colors, by default blue and orange, you will learn how to change colors later in this chapter.By comparing the two plots, I think it is safe to say that they both gives us the same conclusion: the newer the car, the faster it drives.ADVERTISEMENTColorsYou can set your own color for each scatter plot with the color or the c argument:ExampleSet your own color of the markers:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])plt.scatter(x, y, color = \\'hotpink\\')x = np.array([2,2,8,1,15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12])y = np.array([100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85])plt.scatter(x, y, color = \\'#88c999\\')plt.show()Result:Color Each DotYou can even set a specific color for each dot by using an array of colors as value for the c argument:Note: You cannot use the color argument for this, only the c argument.ExampleSet your own color of the markers:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])colors = np.array([\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\",\"yellow\",\"pink\",\"black\",\"orange\",\"purple\",\"beige\",\"brown\",\"gray\",\"cyan\",\"magenta\"])plt.scatter(x, y, c=colors)plt.show()Result:ColorMapThe Matplotlib module has a number of available colormaps.A colormap is like a list of colors, where each color has a value that ranges from 0 to 100.Here is an example of a colormap:This colormap is called \\'viridis\\' and as you can see it ranges from 0, which is a purple color, up to 100, which is a yellow color.How to Use the ColorMapYou can specify the colormap with the keyword argument cmap with the value of the colormap, in this case \\'viridis\\' which is one of the built-in colormaps available in Matplotlib.In addition you have to create an array with values (from 0 to 100), one value for each point in the scatter plot:ExampleCreate a color array, and specify a colormap in the scatter plot:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])colors = np.array([0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])plt.scatter(x, y, c=colors, cmap=\\'viridis\\')plt.show()Result:You can include the colormap in the drawing by including the plt.colorbar() statement:ExampleInclude the actual colormap:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy

157.9096498  176.4248199 ]The hist() function will read the array and produce a histogram:ExampleA simple histogram:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.random.normal(170, 10, 250)plt.hist(x)plt.show() Result:-----Matplotlib Pie ChartsCreating Pie ChartsWith Pyplot, you can use the pie() function to draw pie charts:ExampleGet your own Python ServerA simple pie chart:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])plt.pie(y)plt.show() Result:As you can see the pie chart draws one piece (called a wedge) for each value in the array (in this case [35, 25, 25, 15]).By default the plotting of the first wedge starts from the x-axis and moves counterclockwise:Note: The size of each wedge is determined by comparing the value with all the other values, by using this formula:The value divided by the sum of all values: x/sum(x)ADVERTISEMENTLabelsAdd labels to the pie chart with the label parameter.The label parameter must be an array with one label for each wedge:ExampleA simple pie chart:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels)plt.show() Result:Start AngleAs mentioned the default start angle is at the x-axis, but you can change the start angle by specifying a startangle parameter.The startangle parameter is defined with an angle in degrees, default angle is 0:ExampleStart the first wedge at 90 degrees:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels, startangle = 90)plt.show() Result:ExplodeMaybe you want one of the wedges to stand out? The explode parameter allows you to do that.The explode parameter, if specified, and not None, must be an array with one value for each wedge.Each value represents how far from the center each wedge is displayed:ExamplePull the \"Apples\" wedge 0.2 from the center of the pie:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]myexplode = [0.2, 0, 0, 0]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels, explode = myexplode)plt.show() Result:ShadowAdd a shadow to the pie chart by setting the shadows parameter to True:ExampleAdd a shadow:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]myexplode = [0.2, 0, 0, 0]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels, explode = myexplode, shadow = True)plt.show() Result:ColorsYou can set the color of each wedge with the colors parameter.The colors parameter, if specified, must be an array with one value for each wedge:ExampleSpecify a new color for each wedge:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]mycolors = [\"black\", \"hotpink\", \"b\", \"#4CAF50\"]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels, colors = mycolors)plt.show() Result:You can use Hexadecimal color values, any of the 140 supported color names, or one of these shortcuts:\\'r\\' - Red\\'g\\' - Green\\'b\\' - Blue\\'c\\' - Cyan\\'m\\' - Magenta\\'y\\' - Yellow\\'k\\' - Black\\'w\\' - WhiteLegendTo add a list of explanation for each wedge, use the legend() function:ExampleAdd a legend:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels)plt.legend()plt.show() Result:Legend With HeaderTo add a header to the legend, add the title parameter to the legend function.ExampleAdd a legend with a header:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npy = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])mylabels = [\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\", \"Dates\"]plt.pie(y, labels = mylabels)plt.legend(title = \"Four Fruits:\")plt.show() Result:-----Machine LearningMachine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.Where To Start?In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how tocalculate important numbers based on data sets.We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned.Data SetIn the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.Example of an array:[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]Example of a database:CarnameColorAgeSpeedAutoPassBMWred599YVolvoblack786YVWgray887NVWwhite788YFordwhite2111YVWwhite1786YTeslared2103YBMWblack987YVolvogray494NFordwhite1178NToyotagray1277NVWwhite985NToyotablue686YBy looking at the array, we can guess that the average value is probably around 80 or 90, and we are also able to determine the highest value and the lowest value, but what else can we do?And by looking at the database we can see that the most popular color is white, and the oldest car is 17 years, but what if we could predict if a car had an AutoPass, just by looking at the other values?That is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome!In Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the different concepts of machine learning, and we will work with small easy-to-understand data sets.ADVERTISEMENTData TypesTo analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.We can split the data types into three main categories:NumericalCategoricalOrdinalNumerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:Discrete Data- numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.Continuous Data- numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the sizeof an itemCategorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.You will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the next chapters.-----Machine Learning - Mean Median ModeMean, Median, and ModeWhat can we learn from looking at a group of numbers?In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:Mean - The average valueMedian - The mid point valueMode - The most common valueExample: We have registered the speed of 13 cars:speed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]What is the average, the middle, or the most common speed value?MeanThe mean value is the average value.To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:(99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77The NumPy module has a method for this. Learn about the NumPy module in our NumPy Tutorial.ExampleGet your own Python ServerUse the NumPy mean() method to find the average speed:import numpyspeed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]x = numpy.mean(speed)print(x)ADVERTISEMENTMedianThe median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values:77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111It is important that the numbers are sorted before you can find the median.The NumPy module has a method for this:ExampleUse the NumPy median() method to find the middle value:import numpyspeed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]x = numpy.median(speed)print(x)If there are two numbers in the middle, divide the sum of those numbers by two.77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 94, 98, 99, 103(86 + 87) / 2 = 86.5ExampleUsing the NumPy module:import numpyspeed = [99,86,87,88,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]x = numpy.median(speed)print(x)ModeThe Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times:99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86The SciPy module has a method for this. Learn about the SciPy module in our SciPy Tutorial.ExampleUse the SciPy mode() method to find the number that appears the most:from scipy import statsspeed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]x = stats.mode(speed)print(x)Chapter SummaryThe Mean, Median, and Mode are techniques that are often used in Machine Learning, so it is important to understand the concept behind them.-----Machine Learning - Standard DeviationWhat is Standard Deviation?Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]The standard deviation is:0.9Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value,which is 86.4.Let us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range:speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]The standard deviation is:37.85Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean value, which is 77.4.As you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are spreadout over a wider range.The NumPy module has a method to calculate the standard deviation:ExampleGet your own Python ServerUse the NumPy std() method to find the standard deviation:import numpyspeed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]x = numpy.std(speed)print(x)Exampleimport numpyspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]x = numpy.std(speed)print(x)Learn to Filter Data in Python Like a Data AnalystTry a hands-on training sessions with step-by-step guidance from an expert. Try the guided project made in collaboration with Coursera now!VarianceVariance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation!Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:1. Find the mean:(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.42. For each value: find the difference from the mean: 32 - 77.4 = -45.4111 - 77.4 =  33.6138 - 77.4 =  60.6 28 - 77.4 = -49.4 59 - 77.4 = -18.4 77 - 77.4 = - 0.4 97 - 77.4 =  19.63. For each difference: find the square value:(-45.4)2 = 2061.16  (33.6)2 = 1128.96  (60.6)2 = 3672.36 (-49.4)2 = 2440.36 (-18.4)2 =  338.56 (- 0.4)2 =    0.16  (19.6)2 =  384.16 4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2 Luckily, NumPy has a method to calculate the variance:ExampleUse the NumPy var() method to find the variance:import numpyspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]x = numpy.var(speed)print(x)Standard DeviationAs we have learned, the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:â1432.25 = 37.85 \\x88\\x9aOr, as in the example from before, use the NumPy to calculate the standard deviation:ExampleUse the NumPy std() method to find the standard deviation:import numpyspeed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]x = numpy.std(speed)print(x)SymbolsStandard Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma: Ï \\x83Variance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Squared: Ï 2 \\x83Chapter SummaryThe Standard Deviation and Variance are terms that are often used in Machine Learning, so it is important to understand how to get them, and the concept behind them.-----Machine Learning - PercentilesWhat are Percentiles?Percentiles are used in statistics to give you a number that describes the valuethat a given percent of the values are lower than.Example: Let\\'s say we have an array of the ages of all the people that live in astreet.ages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]What is the 75. percentile? The answer is 43, meaning that 75% of the people are43 or younger.The NumPy module has a method for finding the specified percentile:ExampleGet your own Python ServerUse the NumPy percentile() method to find the percentiles:import numpyages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]x = numpy.percentile(ages, 75)print(x)ExampleWhat is the age that 90% of the people are younger than?import numpyages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]x = numpy.percentile(ages, 90)print(x)-----Machine Learning - Data DistributionData DistributionEarlier in this tutorial we have worked with very small amounts of data in our examples, just to understand the different concepts.In the real world, the data sets are much bigger, but it can be difficult to gather real world data, at least at an early stage of a project.How Can we Get Big Data Sets?To create big data sets for testing, we use the Python module NumPy, which comeswith a number of methods to create random data sets, of any size.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate an array containing 250 random floats between 0 and 5:import numpyx = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 250)print(x)HistogramTo visualize the data set we can draw a histogram with the data we collected.We will use the Python module Matplotlib to draw a histogram.Learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial.ExampleDraw a histogram:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 250)plt.hist(x, 5)plt.show()Result:Histogram ExplainedWe use the array from the example above to draw a histogram with 5 bars.The first bar represents how many values in the array are between 0 and 1.The second bar represents how many values are between 1 and 2.Etc.Which gives us this result:52 values are between 0 and 148 values are between 1 and 249 values are between 2 and 351 values are between 3 and 450 values are between 4 and 5Note: The array values are random numbers and will not show the exact same result on your computer.Big Data DistributionsAn array containing 250 values is not considered very big, but now you know how to create a random set of values, and by changing the parameters, you can createthe data set as big as you want.ExampleCreate an array with 100000 random numbers, and display them using a histogram with 100 bars:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 100000)plt.hist(x, 100)plt.show()-----Machine Learning - Normal Data DistributionNormal Data DistributionIn the previous chapter we learned how to create a completely random array, of agiven size, and between two given values.In this chapter we will learn how to create an array where the values are concentrated around a given value.In probability theory this kind of data distribution is known as the normal datadistribution, or the Gaussian data distribution, after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss who came up with the formula of this data distribution.ExampleGet your own Python ServerA typical normal data distribution:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = numpy.random.normal(5.0, 1.0, 100000)plt.hist(x, 100)plt.show()Result:Note: A normal distribution graph is also known as the bell curve because of it\\'s characteristic shape of a bell.Histogram ExplainedWe use the array from the numpy.random.normal() method, with 100000 values,  to draw a histogram with 100 bars.We specify that the mean value is 5.0, and the standard deviation is 1.0.Meaning that the values should be concentrated around 5.0, and rarely further away than 1.0 from the mean.And as you can see from the histogram, most values are between 4.0 and 6.0, witha top at approximately 5.0.-----Machine Learning - Scatter PlotScatter PlotA scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by adot.The Matplotlib module has a method for drawing scatter plots, it needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for the values of the y-axis:x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]The x array represents the age of each car.The y array represents the speed of each car.ExampleGet your own Python ServerUse the scatter() method to draw a scatter plot diagram:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:Scatter Plot ExplainedThe x-axis represents ages, and the y-axis represents speeds.What we can read from the diagram is that the two fastest cars were both 2 yearsold, and the slowest car was 12 years old.Note: It seems that the newer the car, the faster it drives, but that could be acoincidence, after all we only registered 13 cars.ADVERTISEMENTRandom Data DistributionsIn Machine Learning the data sets can contain thousands-, or even millions, of values.You might not have real world data when you are testing an algorithm, you might have to use randomly generated values.As we have learned in the previous chapter, the NumPy module can help us with that!Let us create two arrays that are both filled with 1000 random numbers from a normal data distribution.The first array will have the mean set to 5.0 with a standard deviation of 1.0.The second array will have the mean set to 10.0 with a standard deviation of 2.0:ExampleA scatter plot with 1000 dots:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = numpy.random.normal(5.0, 1.0, 1000)y = numpy.random.normal(10.0, 2.0, 1000)plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:Scatter Plot ExplainedWe can see that the dots are concentrated around the value 5 on the x-axis, and 10 on the y-axis.We can also see that the spread is wider on the y-axis than on the x-axis.-----Machine Learning - Linear RegressionRegressionThe term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.Linear RegressionLinear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.This line can be used to predict future values.In Machine Learning, predicting the future is very important.How Does it Work?Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.In the example below, the x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents speed. We have registered the age and speed of 13 cars as they were passing a tollbooth. Let us see if the data we collected could be used in a linear regression:ExampleGet your own Python ServerStart by drawing a scatter plot:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:ExampleImport scipy and draw the line of Linear Regression:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scipy import statsx = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)def myfunc(x):  return slope * x + interceptmymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))plt.scatter(x, y)plt.plot(x, mymodel)plt.show()Result:Example ExplainedImport the modules you need.You can learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial.You can learn about the SciPy module in our SciPy Tutorial.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scipy import statsCreate the arrays that represent the values of the x and y axis:x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]Execute a method that returns some important key values of Linear Regression:slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)Create a function that uses the slope and intercept values to return a new value. This new value represents where on the y-axis the corresponding x value will be placed:def myfunc(x):  return slope * x + interceptRun each value of the x array through the function. This will result in a new array with new values for the y-axis:mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))Draw the original scatter plot:plt.scatter(x, y)Draw the line of linear regression:plt.plot(x, mymodel)Display the diagram:plt.show()ADVERTISEMENTR for RelationshipIt is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything.This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r.The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related.Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.ExampleHow well does my data fit in a linear regression?from scipy import statsx = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)print(r)Note: The result -0.76 shows that there is a relationship, not perfect, but it indicates that we could use linear regression in future predictions.Predict Future ValuesNow we can use the information we have gathered to predict future values.Example: Let us try to predict the speed of a 10 years old car.To do so, we need the same myfunc() function from the example above:def myfunc(x):  return slope * x + interceptExamplePredict the speed of a 10 years old car:from scipy import statsx = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)def myfunc(x):  return slope * x + interceptspeed = myfunc(10)print(speed)The example predicted a speed at 85.6, which we also could read from the diagram:Bad Fit?Let us create an example where linear regression would not be the best method topredict future values.ExampleThese values for the x- and y-axis should result in a very bad fit for linear regression:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scipy import statsx = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]y = [21,46,3,35,67,95,53,72,58,10,26,34,90,33,38,20,56,2,47,15]slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)def myfunc(x):  return slope * x + interceptmymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))plt.scatter(x, y)plt.plot(x, mymodel)plt.show()Result:And the r for relationship?ExampleYou should get a very low r value.import numpyfrom scipy import statsx = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]y = [21,46,3,35,67,95,53,72,58,10,26,34,90,33,38,20,56,2,47,15]slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)print(r)The result: 0.013 indicates a very bad relationship, and tells us that this dataset is not suitable for linear regression.-----Machine Learning - Polynomial RegressionPolynomial RegressionIf your data points clearly will not fit a linear regression (a straight line through all data points), it might be ideal for polynomial regression.Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between thevariables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points.How Does it Work?Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of polynomial regression. We will show you how to use these methods insteadof going through the mathematic formula.In the example below, we have registered 18 cars as they were passing a certain tollbooth.We have registered the car\\'s speed, and the time of day (hour) the passing occurred.The x-axis represents the hours of the day and the y-axis represents the speed:ExampleGet your own Python ServerStart by drawing a scatter plot:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22]y = [100,90,80,60,60,55,60,65,70,70,75,76,78,79,90,99,99,100]plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:ExampleImport numpy and matplotlib then draw the line of Polynomial Regression:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22]y = [100,90,80,60,60,55,60,65,70,70,75,76,78,79,90,99,99,100]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))myline = numpy.linspace(1, 22, 100)plt.scatter(x, y)plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))plt.show()Result:Example ExplainedImport the modules you need.You can learn about the NumPy module in our NumPy Tutorial.You can learn about the SciPy module in our SciPy Tutorial.import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltCreate the arrays that represent the values of the x and y axis:x = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22]y = [100,90,80,60,60,55,60,65,70,70,75,76,78,79,90,99,99,100]NumPy has a method that lets us make a polynomial model:mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))Then specify how the line will display, we start at position 1, and end at position 22:myline = numpy.linspace(1, 22, 100)Draw the original scatter plot:plt.scatter(x, y)Draw the line of polynomial regression:plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))Display the diagram:plt.show()ADVERTISEMENTR-SquaredIt is important to know how well the relationship between the values of the x- and y-axis is, if there are no relationship the polynomial regression can not beused to predict anything.The relationship is measured with a value called the r-squared.The r-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 means 100% related.Python and the Sklearn module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y arrays:ExampleHow well does my data fit in a polynomial regression?import numpyfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_scorex = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22]y = [100,90,80,60,60,55,60,65,70,70,75,76,78,79,90,99,99,100]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))print(r2_score(y, mymodel(x)))Note: The result 0.94 shows that there is a very good relationship, and we can use polynomial regression in future predictions.Predict Future ValuesNow we can use the information we have gathered to predict future values.Example: Let us try to predict the speed of a car that passes the tollbooth at around the time 17:00:To do so, we need the same mymodel array from the example above:mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))ExamplePredict the speed of a car passing at 17:00:import numpyfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_scorex = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22]y = [100,90,80,60,60,55,60,65,70,70,75,76,78,79,90,99,99,100]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))speed = mymodel(17)print(speed)The example predicted a speed to be 88.87, which we also could read from the diagram:Bad Fit?Let us create an example where polynomial regression would not be the best method to predict future values.ExampleThese values for the x- and y-axis should result in a very bad fit for polynomial regression:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]y = [21,46,3,35,67,95,53,72,58,10,26,34,90,33,38,20,56,2,47,15]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))myline = numpy.linspace(2, 95, 100)plt.scatter(x, y)plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))plt.show()Result:And the r-squared value?ExampleYou should get a very low r-squared value.import numpyfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_scorex = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]y = [21,46,3,35,67,95,53,72,58,10,26,34,90,33,38,20,56,2,47,15]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 3))print(r2_score(y, mymodel(x)))The result: 0.00995 indicates a very bad relationship, and tells us that this data set is not suitable for polynomial regression.Machine Learning - Multiple RegressionMultiple RegressionMultiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more variables.Take a look at the data set below, it contains some information about cars.CarModelVolumeWeightCO2ToyotaAygo100079099MitsubishiSpace Star1200116095SkodaCitigo100092995Fiat50090086590MiniCooper15001140105VWUp!1000929105SkodaFabia1400110990MercedesA-Class1500136592FordFiesta1500111298AudiA11600115099HyundaiI20110098099SuzukiSwift1300990101FordFiesta1000111299HondaCivic1600125294HundaiI301600132697OpelAstra1600133097BMW11600136599Mazda322001280104SkodaRapid16001119104FordFocus20001328105FordMondeo1600158494OpelInsignia2000142899MercedesC-Class2100136599SkodaOctavia1600141599VolvoS602000141599MercedesCLA15001465102AudiA420001490104AudiA620001725114VolvoV7016001523109BMW520001705114MercedesE-Class21001605115VolvoXC7020001746117FordB-Max16001235104BMW216001390108OpelZafira16001405109MercedesSLK25001395120We can predict the CO2 emission of a car based on the size of the engine, but with multiple regression we can throw in more variables, like the weight of the car, to make the prediction more accurate.How Does it Work?In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module.import pandasLearn about the Pandas module in our Pandas Tutorial.The Pandas module allows us to read csv files and return a DataFrame object.The file is meant for testing purposes only, you can download it here: data.csvdf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")Then make a list of the independent values and call this variable X.Put the dependent values in a variable called y.X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]y = df[\\'CO2\\']Tip: It is common to name the list of independent values with a upper case X, and the list of dependent values with a lower case y.We will use some methods from the sklearn module, so we will have to import thatmodule as well:from sklearn import linear_modelFrom the sklearn module we will use the LinearRegression() method to create a linear regression object.This object has a method called fit() that takes the independent and dependent values as parameters and fills the regression object with data that describes the relationship:regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()regr.fit(X, y)Now we have a regression object that are ready to predict CO2 values based on a car\\'s weight and volume:#predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is1300cm3:predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]])ExampleGet your own Python ServerSee the whole example in action:import pandasfrom sklearn import linear_modeldf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]y = df[\\'CO2\\']regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()regr.fit(X, y)#predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is1300cm3:predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]])print(predictedCO2)Result:[107.2087328]We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 2300 kg, will release approximately 107 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives.ADVERTISEMENTCoefficientThe coefficient is a factor that describes the relationship with an unknown variable.Example: if x is a variable, then 2x is x two times. x is the unknown variable, and the number 2 is the coefficient.In this case, we can ask for the coefficient value of weight against CO2, and for volume against CO2. The answer(s) we get tells us what would happen if we increase, or decrease, one of the independent values.ExamplePrint the coefficient values of the regression object:import pandasfrom sklearn import linear_modeldf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]y = df[\\'CO2\\']regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()regr.fit(X, y)print(regr.coef_)Result:[0.00755095 0.00780526]Result ExplainedThe result array represents the coefficient values of weight and volume.Weight: 0.00755095Volume: 0.00780526These values tell us that if the weight increase by 1kg, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00755095g.And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1 cm3, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00780526 g.I think that is a fair guess, but let test it!We have already predicted that if a car with a 1300cm3 engine weighs 2300kg, theCO2 emission will be approximately 107g.What if we increase the weight with 1000kg?ExampleCopy the example from before, but change the weight from 2300 to 3300:import pandasfrom sklearn import linear_modeldf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]y = df[\\'CO2\\']regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()regr.fit(X, y)predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[3300, 1300]])print(predictedCO2)Result:[114.75968007]We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 3300 kg, will release approximately 115 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives.Which shows that the coefficient of 0.00755095 is correct:107.2087328 + (1000 * 0.00755095) = 114.75968-----Machine Learning - ScaleScale FeaturesWhen your data has different values, and even different measurement units, it can be difficult to compare them. What is kilograms compared to meters? Or altitude compared to time?The answer to this problem is scaling. We can scale data into new values that are easier to compare.Take a look at the table below, it is the same data set that we used in the multiple regression chapter, but this time the volume column contains values in liters instead of cm3 (1.0 instead of 1000).CarModelVolumeWeightCO2ToyotaAygo1.079099MitsubishiSpace Star1.2116095SkodaCitigo1.092995Fiat5000.986590MiniCooper1.51140105VWUp!1.0929105SkodaFabia1.4110990MercedesA-Class1.5136592FordFiesta1.5111298AudiA11.6115099HyundaiI201.198099SuzukiSwift1.3990101FordFiesta1.0111299HondaCivic1.6125294HundaiI301.6132697OpelAstra1.6133097BMW11.6136599Mazda32.21280104SkodaRapid1.61119104FordFocus2.01328105FordMondeo1.6158494OpelInsignia2.0142899MercedesC-Class2.1136599SkodaOctavia1.6141599VolvoS602.0141599MercedesCLA1.51465102AudiA42.01490104AudiA62.01725114VolvoV701.61523109BMW52.01705114MercedesE-Class2.11605115VolvoXC702.01746117FordB-Max1.61235104BMW21.61390108OpelZafira1.61405109MercedesSLK2.51395120It can be difficult to compare the volume 1.0 with the weight 790, but if we scale them both into comparable values, we can easily see how much one value is compared to the other.There are different methods for scaling data, in this tutorial we will use a method called standardization.The standardization method uses this formula:z = (x - u) / sWhere z is the new value, x is the original value, u is the mean and s is the standard deviation.If you take the weight column from the data set above, the first value is 790, and the scaled value will be:(790 - 1292.23) / 238.74 = -2.1If you take the volume column from the data set above, the first value is 1.0, and the scaled value will be:(1.0 - 1.61) / 0.38 = -1.59Now you can compare -2.1 with -1.59 instead of comparing 790 with 1.0.You do not have to do this manually, the Python sklearn module has a method called StandardScaler() which returns a Scaler object with methods for transforming data sets.ExampleGet your own Python ServerScale all values in the Weight and Volume columns:import pandasfrom sklearn import linear_modelfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerscale = StandardScaler()df = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]scaledX = scale.fit_transform(X)print(scaledX)Result:Note that the first two values are -2.1 and -1.59, which corresponds to our calculations:[[-2.10389253 -1.59336644] [-0.55407235 -1.07190106] [-1.52166278 -1.59336644] [-1.78973979 -1.85409913] [-0.63784641 -0.28970299] [-1.52166278 -1.59336644] [-0.76769621 -0.55043568] [ 0.3046118  -0.28970299] [-0.7551301  -0.28970299] [-0.59595938 -0.0289703 ] [-1.30803892 -1.33263375] [-1.26615189 -0.81116837] [-0.7551301  -1.59336644] [-0.16871166 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.14125238 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.15800719 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.3046118  -0.0289703 ] [-0.05142797  1.53542584] [-0.72580918 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.14962979  1.01396046] [ 1.2219378  -0.0289703 ] [ 0.5685001   1.01396046] [ 0.3046118   1.27469315] [ 0.51404696 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.51404696  1.01396046] [ 0.72348212 -0.28970299] [ 0.8281997   1.01396046] [ 1.81254495  1.01396046] [ 0.96642691 -0.0289703 ] [ 1.72877089  1.01396046] [ 1.30990057  1.27469315] [ 1.90050772  1.01396046] [-0.23991961 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.40932938 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.47215993 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.4302729   2.31762392]]ADVERTISEMENTPredict CO2 ValuesThe task in the Multiple Regression chapter was to predict the CO2 emission froma car when you only knew its weight and volume.When the data set is scaled, you will have to use the scale when you predict values:ExamplePredict the CO2 emission from a 1.3 liter car that weighs 2300 kilograms:import pandasfrom sklearn import linear_modelfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerscale = StandardScaler()df = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")X = df[[\\'Weight\\', \\'Volume\\']]y = df[\\'CO2\\']scaledX = scale.fit_transform(X)regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()regr.fit(scaledX, y)scaled = scale.transform([[2300, 1.3]])predictedCO2 = regr.predict([scaled[0]])print(predictedCO2)Result:[107.2087328]-----Machine Learning - Train/TestEvaluate Your ModelIn Machine Learning we create models to predict the outcome of certain events, like in the previous chapter where we predicted the CO2 emission of a car when we knew the weight and engine size.To measure if the model is good enough, we can use a method called Train/Test.What is Train/TestTrain/Test is a method to measure the accuracy of your model.It is called Train/Test because you split the data set into two sets: a trainingset and a testing set.80% for training, and 20% for testing.You train the model using the training set.You test the model using the testing set.Train the model means create the model.Test the model means test the accuracy of the model.Start With a Data SetStart with a data set you want to test.Our data set illustrates 100 customers in a shop, and their shopping habits.ExampleGet your own Python Serverimport numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltnumpy.random.seed(2)x = numpy.random.normal(3, 1, 100)y = numpy.random.normal(150, 40, 100) / xplt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()Result:The x axis represents the number of minutes before making a purchase.The y axis represents the amount of money spent on the purchase.ADVERTISEMENTSplit Into Train/TestThe training set should be a random selection of 80% of the original data.The testing set should be the remaining 20%.train_x = x[:80]train_y = y[:80]test_x = x[80:]test_y = y[80:]Display the Training SetDisplay the same scatter plot with the training set:Exampleplt.scatter(train_x, train_y)plt.show()Result:It looks like the original data set, so it seems to be a fair selection:Display the Testing SetTo make sure the testing set is not completely different, we will take a look atthe testing set as well.Exampleplt.scatter(test_x, test_y)plt.show()Result:The testing set also looks like the original data set:Fit the Data SetWhat does the data set look like? In my opinion I think the best fit would be a polynomial regression, so let us draw a line of polynomial regression.To draw a line through the data points, we use the plot() method of the matplotlib module:ExampleDraw a polynomial regression line through the data points:import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltnumpy.random.seed(2)x = numpy.random.normal(3, 1, 100)y = numpy.random.normal(150, 40, 100) / xtrain_x = x[:80]train_y = y[:80]test_x = x[80:]test_y = y[80:]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(train_x, train_y, 4))myline = numpy.linspace(0, 6, 100)plt.scatter(train_x, train_y)plt.plot(myline, mymodel(myline))plt.show()Result:The result can back my suggestion of the data set fitting a polynomial regression, even though it would give us some weird results if we try to predictvalues outside of the data set. Example: the line indicates that a customer spending 6 minutes in the shop would make a purchase worth 200. That is probablya sign of overfitting.But what about the R-squared score? The R-squared score is a good indicator of how well my data set is fitting the model.R2Remember R2, also known as R-squared?It measures the relationship between the x axis and the y axis, and the value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 means totally related.The sklearn module has a method called r2_score() that will help us find this relationship.In this case we would like to measure the relationship between the minutes a customer stays in the shop and how much money they spend.ExampleHow well does my training data fit in a polynomial regression?import numpyfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_scorenumpy.random.seed(2)x = numpy.random.normal(3, 1, 100)y = numpy.random.normal(150, 40, 100) / xtrain_x = x[:80]train_y = y[:80]test_x = x[80:]test_y = y[80:]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(train_x, train_y, 4))r2 = r2_score(train_y, mymodel(train_x))print(r2)Note: The result 0.799 shows that there is a OK relationship.Bring in the Testing SetNow we have made a model that is OK, at least when it comes to training data.Now we want to test the model with the testing data as well, to see if gives us the same result.ExampleLet us find the R2 score when using testing data:import numpyfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_scorenumpy.random.seed(2)x = numpy.random.normal(3, 1, 100)y = numpy.random.normal(150, 40, 100) / xtrain_x = x[:80]train_y = y[:80]test_x = x[80:]test_y = y[80:]mymodel = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(train_x, train_y, 4))r2 = r2_score(test_y, mymodel(test_x))print(r2)Note: The result 0.809 shows that the model fits the testing set as well, and weare confident that we can use the model to predict future values.Predict ValuesNow that we have established that our model is OK, we can start predicting new values.ExampleHow much money will a buying customer spend, if she or he stays in the shop for 5 minutes?print(mymodel(5))The example predicted the customer to spend 22.88 dollars, as seems to correspond to the diagram:-----Machine Learning - Decision TreeDecision TreeIn this chapter we will show you how to make a \"Decision Tree\". A Decision Tree is a Flow Chart, and can help you make decisions based on previous experience.In the example, a person will try to decide if he/she should go to a comedy showor not.Luckily our example person has registered every time there was a comedy show in town, and registered some information about the comedian, and also registered ifhe/she went or not.AgeExperienceRankNationalityGo36109UKNO42124USANO2346NNO5244USANO43218USAYES44145UKNO6637NYES35149UKYES52137NYES3559NYES2435USANO1837UKYES4599UKYESNow, based on this data set, Python can create a decision tree that can be used to decide if any new shows are worth attending to.ADVERTISEMENTHow Does it Work?First, read the dataset with pandas:ExampleGet your own Python ServerRead and print the data set:import pandasdf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")print(df)To make a decision tree, all data has to be numerical.We have to convert the non numerical columns \\'Nationality\\' and \\'Go\\' into numerical values.Pandas has a map() method that takes a dictionary with information on how to convert the values.\\'UK\\': 0, \\'USA\\': 1, \\'N\\': 2Means convert the values \\'UK\\' to 0, \\'USA\\' to 1, and \\'N\\' to 2.ExampleChange string values into numerical values:d = \\'UK\\': 0, \\'USA\\': 1, \\'N\\': 2df[\\'Nationality\\'] = df[\\'Nationality\\'].map(d)d = \\'YES\\': 1, \\'NO\\': 0df[\\'Go\\'] = df[\\'Go\\'].map(d)print(df)Then we have to separate the feature columns from the target column.The feature columns are the columns that we try to predict from, and the target column is the column with the values we try to predict.ExampleX is the feature columns, y is the target column:features = [\\'Age\\', \\'Experience\\', \\'Rank\\', \\'Nationality\\']X = df[features]y = df[\\'Go\\']print(X)print(y)Now we can create the actual decision tree, fit it with our details. Start by importing the modules we need:ExampleCreate and display a Decision Tree:import pandasfrom sklearn import treefrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifierimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdf = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\")d = \\'UK\\': 0, \\'USA\\': 1, \\'N\\': 2df[\\'Nationality\\'] = df[\\'Nationality\\'].map(d)d = \\'YES\\': 1, \\'NO\\': 0df[\\'Go\\'] = df[\\'Go\\'].map(d)features = [\\'Age\\', \\'Experience\\', \\'Rank\\', \\'Nationality\\']X = df[features]y = df[\\'Go\\']dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier()dtree = dtree.fit(X, y)tree.plot_tree(dtree, feature_names=features)Result ExplainedThe decision tree uses your earlier decisions to calculate the odds for you to wanting to go see a comedian or not.Let us read the different aspects of the decision tree:RankRank  .5print(f\\'accuracy score: accuracy_score(y, y_pred)\\')cf_mat = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)print(\\'Confusion matrix\\')print(cf_mat)print(f\\'class 0 accuracy: cf_mat[0][0]/n_0\\')print(f\\'class 1 accuracy: cf_mat[1][1]/n_1\\')ADVERTISEMENTAlthough we obtain a very high accuracy, the model provided no information aboutthe data so it\\'s not useful. We accurately predict class 1 100% of the time while inaccurately predict class 0 0% of the time. At the expense of accuracy, it might be better to have a model that can somewhat separate the two classes.Example# below are the probabilities obtained from a hypothetical model that doesn\\'t always predict the modey_proba_2 = np.array(    np.random.uniform(0, .7, n_0).tolist() +     np.random.uniform(.3, 1, n_1).tolist())y_pred_2 = y_proba_2 > .5print(f\\'accuracy score: accuracy_score(y, y_pred_2)\\')cf_mat = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred_2)print(\\'Confusion matrix\\')print(cf_mat)print(f\\'class 0 accuracy: cf_mat[0][0]/n_0\\')print(f\\'class 1 accuracy: cf_mat[1][1]/n_1\\')For the second set of predictions, we do not have as high of an accuracy score as the first but the accuracy for each class is more balanced. Using accuracy asan evaluation metric we would rate the first model higher than the second even though it doesn\\'t tell us anything about the data.In cases like this, using another evaluation metric like AUC would be preferred.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltdef plot_roc_curve(true_y, y_prob):    \"\"\"    plots the roc curve based of the probabilities    \"\"\"    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(true_y, y_prob)    plt.plot(fpr, tpr)    plt.xlabel(\\'False Positive Rate\\')    plt.ylabel(\\'True Positive Rate\\')ExampleModel 1:plot_roc_curve(y, y_proba)print(f\\'model 1 AUC score: roc_auc_score(y, y_proba)\\')Result model 1 AUC score: 0.5 ExampleModel 2:plot_roc_curve(y, y_proba_2)print(f\\'model 2 AUC score: roc_auc_score(y, y_proba_2)\\')Result model 2 AUC score: 0.8270551578947367An AUC score of around .5 would mean that the model is unable to make a distinction between the two classes and the curve would look like a line with a slope of 1. An AUC score closer to 1 means that the model has the ability to separate the two classes and the curve would come closer to the top left corner of the graph.ProbabilitiesBecause AUC is a metric that utilizes probabilities of the class predictions, wecan be more confident in a model that has a higher AUC score than one with a lower score even if they have similar accuracies.In the data below, we have two sets of probabilites from hypothetical models. The first has probabilities that are not as \"confident\" when predicting the two classes (the probabilities are close to .5). The second has probabilities that are more \"confident\" when predicting the two classes (the probabilities are close to the extremes of 0 or 1).Exampleimport numpy as npn = 10000y = np.array([0] * n + [1] * n)# y_prob_1 = np.array(    np.random.uniform(.25, .5, n//2).tolist() +     np.random.uniform(.3, .7, n).tolist() +     np.random.uniform(.5, .75, n//2).tolist())y_prob_2 = np.array(    np.random.uniform(0, .4, n//2).tolist() +     np.random.uniform(.3, .7, n).tolist() +     np.random.uniform(.6, 1, n//2).tolist())print(f\\'model 1 accuracy score: accuracy_score(y, y_prob_1>.5)\\')print(f\\'model 2 accuracy score: accuracy_score(y, y_prob_2>.5)\\')print(f\\'model 1 AUC score: roc_auc_score(y, y_prob_1)\\')print(f\\'model 2 AUC score: roc_auc_score(y, y_prob_2)\\')ExamplePlot model 1:plot_roc_curve(y, y_prob_1)ResultExamplePlot model 2:fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, y_prob_2)plt.plot(fpr, tpr)ResultEven though the accuracies for the two models are similar, the model with the higher AUC score will be more reliable because it takes into account the predicted probability. It is more likely to give you higher accuracy when predicting future data.-----Machine Learning - K-nearest neighbors (KNN)On this page, W3schools.com collaborates with NYC Data Science Academy, to deliver digital training content to our students.KNNKNN is a simple, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be used forclassification or regression tasks - and is also frequently used in missing value imputation. It is based on the idea that the observations closest to a given data point are the most \"similar\" observations in a data set, and we can therefore classify unforeseen points based on the values of the closest existingpoints. By choosing K, the user can select the number of nearby observations to use in the algorithm.Here, we will show you how to implement the KNN algorithm for classification, and show how different values of K affect the results.How does it work?K is the number of nearest neighbors to use. For classification, a majority voteis used to determined which class a new observation should fall into. Larger values of K are often more robust to outliers and produce more stable decision boundaries than very small values (K=3 would be better than K=1, which might produce undesirable results.ExampleGet your own Python ServerStart by visualizing some data points:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [4, 5, 10, 4, 3, 11, 14 , 8, 10, 12]y = [21, 19, 24, 17, 16, 25, 24, 22, 21, 21]classes = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]plt.scatter(x, y, c=classes)plt.show()ResultADVERTISEMENTNow we fit the KNN algorithm with K=1:from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifierdata = list(zip(x, y))knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)knn.fit(data, classes)And use it to classify a new data point:Examplenew_x = 8new_y = 21new_point = [(new_x, new_y)]prediction = knn.predict(new_point)plt.scatter(x + [new_x], y + [new_y], c=classes + [prediction[0]])plt.text(x=new_x-1.7, y=new_y-0.7, s=f\"new point, class: prediction[0]\")plt.show()ResultNow we do the same thing, but with a higher K value which changes the prediction:Exampleknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)knn.fit(data, classes)prediction = knn.predict(new_point)plt.scatter(x + [new_x], y + [new_y], c=classes + [prediction[0]])plt.text(x=new_x-1.7, y=new_y-0.7, s=f\"new point, class: prediction[0]\")plt.show()ResultExample ExplainedImport the modules you need.You can learn about the Matplotlib module in our \"Matplotlib Tutorial.scikit-learn is a popular library for machine learning in Python.import matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifierCreate arrays that resemble variables in a dataset. We have two input features (x and y) and then a target class (class). The input features that are pre-labeled with our target class will be used to predict the class of new data. Note that while we only use two input features here, this method will work with any number of variables:x = [4, 5, 10, 4, 3, 11, 14 , 8, 10, 12]y = [21, 19, 24, 17, 16, 25, 24, 22, 21, 21]classes = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]Turn the input features into a set of points:data = list(zip(x, y))print(data)Result:[(4, 21), (5, 19), (10, 24), (4, 17), (3, 16), (11, 25), (14, 24), (8, 22), (10,21), (12, 21)]Using the input features and target class, we fit a KNN model on the model using1 nearest neighbor:knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)knn.fit(data, classes)Then, we can use the same KNN object to predict the class of new, unforeseen data points. First we create new x and y features, and then call knn.predict() on the new data point to get a class of 0 or 1:new_x = 8new_y = 21new_point = [(new_x, new_y)]prediction = knn.predict(new_point)print(prediction)Result:[0]When we plot all the data along with the new point and class, we can see it\\'s been labeled blue with the 1 class. The text annotation is just to highlight thelocation of the new point:plt.scatter(x + [new_x], y + [new_y], c=classes + [prediction[0]])plt.text(x=new_x-1.7, y=new_y-0.7, s=f\"new point, class: prediction[0]\")plt.show()Result:However, when we changes the number of neighbors to 5, the number of points usedto classify our new point changes. As a result, so does the classification of the new point:knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)knn.fit(data, classes)prediction = knn.predict(new_point)print(prediction)Result:[1]When we plot the class of the new point along with the older points, we note that the color has changed based on the associated class label:plt.scatter(x + [new_x], y + [new_y], c=classes + [prediction[0]])plt.text(x=new_x-1.7, y=new_y-0.7, s=f\"new point, class: prediction[0]\")plt.show()Result:-----Python MySQLPython can be used in database applications.One of the most popular databases is MySQL.MySQL DatabaseTo be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.You can download a MySQL database at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.Install MySQL DriverPython needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.In this tutorial we will use the driver \"MySQL Connector\".We recommend that you use PIP to install \"MySQL Connector\".PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following:Download and install \"MySQL Connector\":C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python36-32\\\\Scripts>python -m pip install mysql-connector-pythonNow you have downloaded and installed a MySQL driver.Test MySQL ConnectorTo test if the installation was successful, or if you already have \"MySQL Connector\" installed, create a Python page with the following content:demo_mysql_test.py:import mysql.connectorIf the above code was executed with no errors, \"MySQL Connector\" is installed and ready to be used.ADVERTISEMENTCreate ConnectionStart by creating a connection to the database.Use the username and password from your MySQL database:demo_mysql_connection.py:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\")print(mydb)Now you can start querying the database using SQL statements.-----Python MySQL Create DatabaseCreating a DatabaseTo create a database in MySQL, use the \"CREATE DATABASE\" statement:ExampleGet your own Python Servercreate a database named \"mydatabase\":import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"CREATE DATABASE mydatabase\")If the above code was executed with no errors, you have successfully created a database.Check if Database ExistsYou can check if a database exist by listing all databases in your system by using the \"SHOW DATABASES\" statement:ExampleReturn a list of your system\\'s databases:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"SHOW DATABASES\")for x in mycursor:  print(x)Or you can try to access the database when making the connection:ExampleTry connecting to the database \"mydatabase\":import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")If the database does not exist, you will get an error.-----Python MySQL Create TableCreating a TableTo create a table in MySQL, use the \"CREATE TABLE\" statement.Make sure you define the name of the database when you create the connectionExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a table named \"customers\":import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE customers (name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))\")If the above code was executed with no errors, you have now successfully createda table.Check if Table ExistsYou can check if a table exist by listing all tables in your database with the \"SHOW TABLES\" statement:ExampleReturn a list of your system\\'s databases:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"SHOW TABLES\")for x in mycursor:  print(x)ADVERTISEMENTPrimary KeyWhen creating a table, you should also create a column with a unique key for each record.This can be done by defining a PRIMARY KEY.We use the statement \"INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY\" which will insert a uniquenumber for each record.

If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated!ADVERTISEMENTPrevent SQL InjectionIt is considered a good practice to escape the values of any query, also in update statements.This is to prevent SQL injections, which is a common web hacking technique to destroy or misuse your database.The mysql.connector module uses the placeholder %s to escape values in the delete statement:ExampleEscape values by using the placeholder %s method:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()sql = \"UPDATE customers SET address = %s WHERE address = %s\"val = (\"Valley 345\", \"Canyon 123\")mycursor.execute(sql, val)mydb.commit()print(mycursor.rowcount, \"record(s) affected\")-----Python MySQL LimitLimit the ResultYou can limit the number of records returned from the query, by using the \"LIMIT\" statement:ExampleGet your own Python ServerSelect the 5 first records in the \"customers\" table:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5\")myresult = mycursor.fetchall()for x in myresult:  print(x)Start From Another PositionIf you want to return five records, starting from the third record, you can use the \"OFFSET\" keyword:ExampleStart from position 3, and return 5 records:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2\")myresult = mycursor.fetchall()for x in myresult:  print(x)-----Python MySQL JoinJoin Two or More TablesYou can combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them, by using a JOIN statement.Consider you have a \"users\" table and a \"products\" table:usersGet your own Python Server id: 1, name: \\'John\\', fav: 154, id: 2, name: \\'Peter\\', fav: 154, id: 3, name: \\'Amy\\', fav: 155, id: 4, name: \\'Hannah\\', fav:, id: 5, name: \\'Michael\\', fav:products id: 154, name: \\'Chocolate Heaven\\' , id: 155, name: \\'Tasty Lemons\\' , id: 156, name: \\'Vanilla Dreams\\' These two tables can be combined by using users\\' fav field and products\\' id field.ExampleJoin users and products to see the name of the users favorite product:import mysql.connectormydb = mysql.connector.connect(  host=\"localhost\",  user=\"yourusername\",  password=\"yourpassword\",  database=\"mydatabase\")mycursor = mydb.cursor()sql = \"SELECT \\\\  users.name AS user, \\\\  products.name AS favorite \\\\  FROM users \\\\  INNER JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id\"mycursor.execute(sql)myresult = mycursor.fetchall()for x in myresult:  print(x)Note: You can use JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. They will both give you the same result.ADVERTISEMENTLEFT JOINIn the example above, Hannah, and Michael were excluded from the result, that isbecause INNER JOIN only shows the records where there is a match.If you want to show all users, even if they do not have a favorite product, use the LEFT JOIN statement:ExampleSelect all users and their favorite product:sql = \"SELECT \\\\  users.name AS user, \\\\  products.name AS favorite \\\\  FROM users \\\\  LEFT JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id\"RIGHT JOINIf you want to return all products, and the users who have them as their favorite, even if no user have them as their favorite, use the RIGHT JOIN statement:ExampleSelect all products, and the user(s) who have them as their favorite:sql = \"SELECT \\\\  users.name AS user, \\\\  products.name AS favorite \\\\  FROM users \\\\  RIGHT JOIN products ON users.fav = products.id\"Note: Hannah and Michael, who have no favorite product, are not included in the result.-----Python MongoDBPython can be used in database applications.One of the most popular NoSQL database is MongoDB.MongoDBMongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable.To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you will need access to a MongoDB database.You can download a free MongoDB database at https://www.mongodb.com.Or get started right away with a MongoDB cloud service at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.PyMongoPython needs a MongoDB driver to access the MongoDB database.In this tutorial we will use the MongoDB driver \"PyMongo\".We recommend that you use PIP to install \"PyMongo\".PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following:Download and install \"PyMongo\":C:\\\\Users\\\\Your Name\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python36-32\\\\Scripts>python -m pip install pymongoNow you have downloaded and installed a mongoDB driver.Test PyMongoTo test if the installation was successful, or if you already have \"pymongo\" installed, create a Python page with the following content:demo_mongodb_test.py:import pymongoIf the above code was executed with no errors, \"pymongo\" is installed and ready to be used.-----Python MongoDB Create DatabaseCreating a DatabaseTo create a database in MongoDB, start by creating a MongoClient object, then specify a connection URL with the correct ip address and the name of the database you want to create.MongoDB will create the database if it does not exist, and make a connection to it.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a database called \"mydatabase\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]Important: In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content!MongoDB waits until you have created a collection (table), with at least one document (record) before it actually creates the database (and collection).Check if Database ExistsRemember: In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content, so if this is your first time creating a database, you should complete the next two chapters (create collection and create document) before you check if the database exists!You can check if a database exist by listing all databases in you system:ExampleReturn a list of your system\\'s databases:print(myclient.list_database_names())Or you can check a specific database by name:ExampleCheck if \"mydatabase\" exists:dblist = myclient.list_database_names()if \"mydatabase\" in dblist:  print(\"The database exists.\")-----Python MongoDB Create CollectionA collection in MongoDB is the same as a table in SQL databases.Creating a CollectionTo create a collection in MongoDB, use database object and specify the name of the collection you want to create.MongoDB will create the collection if it does not exist.ExampleGet your own Python ServerCreate a collection called \"customers\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]Important: In MongoDB, a collection is not created until it gets content!MongoDB waits until you have inserted a document before it actually creates the collection.Check if Collection ExistsRemember: In MongoDB, a collection is not created until it gets content, so if this is your first time creating a collection, you should complete the next chapter (create document) before you check if the collection exists!You can check if a collection exist in a database by listing all collections:ExampleReturn a list of all collections in your database:print(mydb.list_collection_names())Or you can check a specific collection by name:ExampleCheck if the \"customers\" collection exists:collist = mydb.list_collection_names()if \"customers\" in collist:  print(\"The collection exists.\")-----Python MongoDB Insert DocumentA document in MongoDB is the same as a record in SQL databases.Insert Into CollectionTo insert a record, or document as it is called in MongoDB, into a collection, we use the insert_one() method.The first parameter of the insert_one() method is a dictionary containing the name(s) and value(s) of each field in the document you want to insert.ExampleGet your own Python ServerInsert a record in the \"customers\" collection:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mydict =  \"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"Highway 37\" x = mycol.insert_one(mydict)Return the _id FieldThe insert_one() method returns a InsertOneResult object, which has a property, inserted_id, that holds the id of the inserted document.ExampleInsert another record in the \"customers\" collection, and return the value of the_id field:mydict =  \"name\": \"Peter\", \"address\": \"Lowstreet 27\" x = mycol.insert_one(mydict)print(x.inserted_id)If you do not specify an _id field, then MongoDB will add one for you and assigna unique id for each document.In the example above no _id field was specified, so MongoDB assigned a unique _id for the record (document).ADVERTISEMENTInsert Multiple DocumentsTo insert multiple documents into a collection in MongoDB, we use the insert_many() method.The first parameter of the insert_many() method is a list containing dictionaries with the data you want to insert:Exampleimport pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mylist = [   \"name\": \"Amy\", \"address\": \"Apple st 652\",   \"name\": \"Hannah\", \"address\": \"Mountain 21\",   \"name\": \"Michael\", \"address\": \"Valley 345\",   \"name\": \"Sandy\", \"address\": \"Ocean blvd 2\",   \"name\": \"Betty\", \"address\": \"Green Grass 1\",   \"name\": \"Richard\", \"address\": \"Sky st 331\",   \"name\": \"Susan\", \"address\": \"One way 98\",   \"name\": \"Vicky\", \"address\": \"Yellow Garden 2\",   \"name\": \"Ben\", \"address\": \"Park Lane 38\",   \"name\": \"William\", \"address\": \"Central st 954\",   \"name\": \"Chuck\", \"address\": \"Main Road 989\",   \"name\": \"Viola\", \"address\": \"Sideway 1633\"]x = mycol.insert_many(mylist)#print list of the _id values of the inserted documents:print(x.inserted_ids)The insert_many() method returns a InsertManyResult object, which has a property, inserted_ids, that holds the ids of the inserted documents.Insert Multiple Documents, with Specified IDsIf you do not want MongoDB to assign unique ids for you document, you can specify the _id field when you insert the document(s).Remember that the values has to be unique. Two documents cannot have the same _id.Exampleimport pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mylist = [   \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"Highway 37\",   \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Peter\", \"address\": \"Lowstreet 27\",   \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"Amy\", \"address\": \"Apple st 652\",   \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Hannah\", \"address\": \"Mountain 21\",   \"_id\": 5, \"name\": \"Michael\", \"address\": \"Valley 345\",   \"_id\": 6, \"name\": \"Sandy\", \"address\": \"Ocean blvd 2\",   \"_id\": 7, \"name\": \"Betty\", \"address\": \"Green Grass 1\",   \"_id\": 8, \"name\": \"Richard\", \"address\": \"Sky st 331\",   \"_id\": 9, \"name\": \"Susan\", \"address\": \"One way 98\",   \"_id\": 10, \"name\": \"Vicky\", \"address\": \"Yellow Garden 2\",   \"_id\": 11, \"name\": \"Ben\", \"address\": \"Park Lane 38\",   \"_id\": 12, \"name\": \"William\", \"address\": \"Central st 954\",   \"_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Chuck\", \"address\": \"Main Road 989\",   \"_id\": 14, \"name\": \"Viola\", \"address\": \"Sideway 1633\"]x = mycol.insert_many(mylist)#print list of the _id values of the inserted documents:print(x.inserted_ids)-----Python MongoDB FindIn MongoDB we use the find() and find_one() methods to find data in a collection.Just like the SELECT statement is used to find data in a table in a MySQL database.Find OneTo select data from a collection in MongoDB, we can use the find_one() method.The find_one() method returns the first occurrence in the selection.ExampleGet your own Python ServerFind the first document in the customers collection:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]x = mycol.find_one()print(x)Find AllTo select data from a table in MongoDB, we can also use the find() method.The find() method returns all occurrences in the selection.The first parameter of the find() method is a query object. In this example we use an empty query object, which selects all documents in the collection.No parameters in the find() method gives you the same result as SELECT * in MySQL.ExampleReturn all documents in the \"customers\" collection, and print each document:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]for x in mycol.find():  print(x)ADVERTISEMENTReturn Only Some FieldsThe second parameter of the find() method is an object describing which fields to include in the result.This parameter is optional, and if omitted, all fields will be included in the result.ExampleReturn only the names and addresses, not the _ids:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]for x in mycol.find(, \"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1, \"address\": 1 ):  print(x)You are not allowed to specify both 0 and 1 values in the same object (except ifone of the fields is the _id field). If you specify a field with the value 0, all other fields get the value 1, and vice versa:ExampleThis example will exclude \"address\" from the result:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]for x in mycol.find(, \"address\": 0 ):  print(x)ExampleYou get an error if you specify both 0 and 1 values in the same object (except if one of the fields is the _id field):import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]for x in mycol.find(, \"name\": 1, \"address\": 0 ):  print(x)-----Python MongoDB QueryFilter the ResultWhen finding documents in a collection, you can filter the result by using a query object.The first argument of the find() method is a query object, and is used to limit the search.ExampleGet your own Python ServerFind document(s) with the address \"Park Lane 38\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\": \"Park Lane 38\" mydoc = mycol.find(myquery)for x in mydoc:  print(x)Advanced QueryTo make advanced queries you can use modifiers as values in the query object.E.g. to find the documents where the \"address\" field starts with the letter \"S\" or higher (alphabetically), use the greater than modifier: \"$gt\": \"S\":ExampleFind documents where the address starts with the letter \"S\" or higher:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\":  \"$gt\": \"S\"  mydoc = mycol.find(myquery)for x in mydoc:  print(x)Filter With Regular ExpressionsYou can also use regular expressions as a modifier.Regular expressions can only be used to query strings.To find only the documents where the \"address\" field starts with the letter \"S\",use the regular expression \"$regex\": \"^S\":ExampleFind documents where the address starts with the letter \"S\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\":  \"$regex\": \"^S\"  mydoc = mycol.find(myquery)for x in mydoc:  print(x)-----Python MongoDB SortSort the ResultUse the sort() method to sort the result in ascending or descending order.The sort() method takes one parameter for \"fieldname\" and one parameter for \"direction\" (ascending is the default direction).ExampleGet your own Python ServerSort the result alphabetically by name:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mydoc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\")for x in mydoc:  print(x)Sort DescendingUse the value -1 as the second parameter to sort descending.sort(\"name\", 1) #ascendingsort(\"name\", -1) #descendingExampleSort the result reverse alphabetically by name:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mydoc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\", -1)for x in mydoc:  print(x)-----Python MongoDB Delete DocumentDelete DocumentTo delete one document, we use the delete_one() method.The first parameter of the delete_one() method is a query object defining which document to delete.Note: If the query finds more than one document, only the first occurrence is deleted.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDelete the document with the address \"Mountain 21\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\": \"Mountain 21\" mycol.delete_one(myquery)Delete Many DocumentsTo delete more than one document, use the delete_many() method.The first parameter of the delete_many() method is a query object defining whichdocuments to delete.ExampleDelete all documents were the address starts with the letter S:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\": \"$regex\": \"^S\" x = mycol.delete_many(myquery)print(x.deleted_count, \" documents deleted.\")Delete All Documents in a CollectionTo delete all documents in a collection, pass an empty query object to the delete_many() method:ExampleDelete all documents in the \"customers\" collection:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]x = mycol.delete_many()print(x.deleted_count, \" documents deleted.\")-----Python MongoDB Drop CollectionDelete CollectionYou can delete a table, or collection as it is called in MongoDB, by using the drop() method.ExampleGet your own Python ServerDelete the \"customers\" collection:import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]mycol.drop()The drop() method returns true if the collection was dropped successfully, and false if the collection does not exist.-----Python MongoDB UpdateUpdate CollectionYou can update a record, or document as it is called in MongoDB, by using the update_one() method.The first parameter of the update_one() method is a query object defining which document to update.Note: If the query finds more than one record, only the first occurrence is updated.The second parameter is an object defining the new values of the document.ExampleGet your own Python ServerChange the address from \"Valley 345\" to \"Canyon 123\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\": \"Valley 345\" newvalues =  \"$set\":  \"address\": \"Canyon 123\"  mycol.update_one(myquery, newvalues)#print \"customers\" after the update:for x in mycol.find():  print(x)Update ManyTo update all documents that meets the criteria of the query, use the update_many() method.ExampleUpdate all documents where the address starts with the letter \"S\":import pymongomyclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]myquery =  \"address\":  \"$regex\": \"^S\"  newvalues =  \"$set\":  \"name\": \"Minnie\"  x = mycol.update_many(myquery, newvalues)print(x.modified_count, \"documents updated.\")-----Python MongoDB LimitLimit the ResultTo limit the result in MongoDB, we use the limit() method.The limit() method takes one parameter, a number defining how many documents to return.Consider you have a \"customers\" collection:CustomersGet your own Python Server\\'_id\\': 1,

       "> \n",
       "> 在 Python 中，我們可以使用 Matplotlib 庫的 `pyplot` 子模組繪製圓餅圖。以下是步驟：\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **1. 導入必要的模組：**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> ```python\n",
       "> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
       "> import numpy as np  # 可選，用於生成數據\n",
       "> ```\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **2. 準備數據：**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 準備一個數值陣列，代表每個扇形的數值。例如：\n",
       "> \n",
       "> ```python\n",
       "> y = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])  # 各扇形數值\n",
       "> mylabels = [\"蘋果\", \"香蕉\", \"櫻桃\", \"棗子\"]  # 各扇形標籤\n",
       "> ```\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **3. 繪製圓餅圖：**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 使用 `plt.pie()` 函數繪製圓餅圖。\n",
       "> \n",
       "> ```python\n",
       "> plt.pie(y, labels=mylabels)\n",
       "> plt.show()\n",
       "> ```\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **4. 進階設定 (可選)：**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> *   **起始角度:** 使用 `startangle` 參數設定第一個扇形的起始角度 (以角度為單位，預設為 0)。\n",
       "> *   **突出顯示扇形:** 使用 `explode` 參數設定每個扇形與中心的距離，突出顯示特定扇形。\n",
       "> *   **陰影效果:** 使用 `shadow=True` 參數添加陰影效果。\n",
       "> *   **顏色:** 使用 `colors` 參數設定每個扇形的顏色。\n",
       "> *   **圖例:** 使用 `plt.legend()` 函數添加圖例。\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **完整範例：**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> ```python\n",
       "> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
       "> import numpy as np\n",
       "> \n",
       "> y = np.array([35, 25, 25, 15])\n",
       "> mylabels = [\"蘋果\", \"香蕉\", \"櫻桃\", \"棗子\"]\n",
       "> myexplode = [0.2, 0, 0, 0]  # 突出顯示蘋果\n",
       "> mycolors = [\"black\", \"hotpink\", \"b\", \"#4CAF50\"]  # 自定義顏色\n",
       "> \n",
       "> plt.pie(y, labels=mylabels, explode=myexplode, shadow=True, colors=mycolors, startangle=90)\n",
       "> plt.legend(title=\"四種水果:\")\n",
       "> plt.show()\n",

       "> ## 其他注意事項\n",
       "> \n",
       "> *   您可以使用十六進制顏色值、140 種支持的顏色名稱或以下快捷方式設定顏色：\n",
       ">     *   `'r'` - 紅色\n",
       ">     *   `'g'` - 綠色\n",
       ">     *   `'b'` - 藍色\n",
